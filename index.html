Another golfer will also compete--a troubled local war hero, once a champion, who comes with his mentor and caddie, the mysterious Bagger Vance. Sage and charismatic, it is Vance who will ultimately guide the match--for he holds the secret of the Authentic Swing. And he alone can show his prot�g� the way back to glory.</p><p>Steven Pressfield has been an enthusiastic golfer since the age of ten. He is the author of the novel <em>Gates of Fire</em> and a well-known screenwriter whose screenplays include "Above the Law" and "Freejack." He lives in the Los Angeles area.<p>We were crossing between the nines now. The surge to the tenth tee carried the massed throngs away from the ocean to a run of five inland holes. The gallery's weight and depth seemed to cut off all breeze; the heat hit you like a blast oven. The backs of Jones' and Hagen's shirts were drenched with sweat as we climbed the rise to the tenth tee. Junah removed his hat and buried his face in a towel; the moisture was </p><p>dripping from it; I gave him tea and an apple and a big chunk of ice, which he wrapped in his pocket kerchief and applied to his burning neck.</p><p></p><p>The big scoreboard by the tourney tents was visible when he reached the height of the tee. Hagen 35, Jones 36, Junah 41. The nine behind felt like a war zone; it seemed impossible that the competitors still had a siege of 27 more holes to play.</p><p></p><p>Jones lashed a monster down the right side, a screaming yardage-devouring hook that arced out and back over the rough, hit the fairway steaming and bounded forward with overspin to slow finally, curling safely around the flank of a bunker I'd paced off the </p><p>night before at 285.</p><p></p><p>Junah barely noticed, so tightly was he held by Bagger Vance's eyes. "What can I do, Bagger? Tell me." </p><p></p><p>Hagen was stepping to tee his ball; Vance kept his voice low. "I require only one thing of you, Junah. That you swing your True Swing. Your Authentic Swing." </p><p></p><p>"What the hell do you think I want?" Junah hissed. "How do I do it?" </p><p></p><p>He paused for Hagen's address. Sir Walter ripped one, a high dead-straight boomer that was all carry, splitting the middle and landing just a few yards behind Jones', settling onto a clean flat lie, 190 from the 464-yard green. The applause echoed; then the gallery turned to Junah, who still stood over his bag, his face inches from his caddie's. </p><p></p><p>The caddie held out the champion's driver. </p><p></p><p>"Remember, the game is simple. The ball doesn't move. It simply sits and waits. Now strike it, Junah. Hold nothing back. Hit it with everything you have." </p><p></p><p>Vance set Schenectady Slim in Junah's hands. You could see the champion's head was whirling, his brain beyond overload. The gallery sensed an apocalypse. Hagen and Jones did too. I was in terror that Junah might faint, collapse, actually fall down, so dizzy and disorientated did he seem. I shut my eyes, too terrified to watch as Junah teed his ball and stepped to it. I squinted to see him look back at Vance, one last time. Then he set himself, glanced once down the fairway... </p><p></p><p>Junah's clubhead started back. Before it reached the top, the gallery knew. Judge Anderson knew, my father knew, everyone who had ever seen and marveled at Junah's swing when it was on ...they all knew. He was on plane. On track. On rails. The big persimmon </p><p>hit the slot at the top exactly, you could see Junah's wrists cock fully into their ultimate power position, his knees and hips had already started rotating forward into the shot as the clubhead reached its zenith, high and geometric, left arm at full extension, and then, not with a slash or a blast but almost in slow motion the club powered through the hitting zone. The sound was like a bomb. The gallery gasped as the ball exploded off the clubface, low and hissing fire, and boomed down the narrow alley between the massed formations. Heads snapped, trying to follow its speed. There was a quick intake of breath, then a joyous release of tension, applause and a rush of awe and appreciation. I looked at Jones and saw a small curl of pleasure in his lip; he appreciated it too. Hagen was already striding off the tee, head down, ignoring the shot, which meant of course he had seen it and took it seriously. I peered toward the far right bunker, the one Jones' ball had rolled to, whose carry paced off at 285. Junah's drive cleared it on the fly, took one long hard hop, then settled into a low ground-hugging roll, coming to rest 30 yards farther on, 315 from the tee, with Tawdry Jones the forecaddie sprinting in its wake to jubilantly plant his bright white flag. Three-fifteen cold. Thirty yards past Jones, nearly 40 beyond Hagen. </p><p></p><p>Junah himself could barely believe it. Not so much the prodigiousness of the blow, as he had hit many as well and better, but that somehow it had appeared at this time, when his swing had seemed utterly incapable of producing it. He turned to Bagger Vance, as if expecting a winking smile or a thumbs-up. But the caddie was already striding for the fairway, instructing me to give Junah another of my iced apples and make sure he ate it. "You are your swing, Junah," he muttered to the champion as he passed. "We will </p><p>find that swing today and, having found it, nothing will ever take it from you again." </p></p><h2>Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829-1929</h2><p>How the railroads transformed American life between 1829 and 1929, and why the cost of their achievements was so damaging to the social and economic life of the nation. A quite wonderful book...richly textured and intellectually stimulating. &#x2015;Elizabeth Blackmar, Columbia University. Selected by Choice as an outstanding book for 1997.</p><p>The progress represented by the railroad is often taken as an entirely positive trend in American history, but in <i>Passage to Union</i>, historian Sarah H. Gordon shows how the railroad's transformation of American life also exacted some great costs. She pays equal attention to technology and law, noting how the land to be crossed by the railroads all belonged to someone else; the brilliant engineering feats of early tracklaying were thus made possible in part by skillful railroad lawyers such as Abraham Lincoln. <i>Passage to Union</i> follows the story of American railroading from the time when the American West was untouched by tracks and the Southern states stubbornly tried to resist their entry to the decades when Pullman travel tied the nation together for good.<p> Besides detailing the great legal and economic themes of the railroad revolution, Gordon also pays attention to how train travel affected ordinary people, succeeding in making the great national saga of railroads a very human story. Later chapters of the book relate the details of rail travel in the latter half of the 19th century; the design of rail cars, new systems of ticketing, and even the institution of modern luggage all made rail travel a commonplace component of American life. <i>--Robert McNamara</i></p>In Passage to Union, Sarah Gordon has written a richly informed narrative history of the growth of the railroads, an American icon. But her conclusions are surprising. Where the railroads and their entrepreneurs are ordinarily celebrated for their accomplishments, Ms. Gordon finds that the cost of their achievements was high. Conflicts of interest - at local, state, and regional levels - characterized railroad growth at every stage. Despite the stated aims of government and the railroad corporations to promote settlement and commerce, Ms. Gordon shows that the states lost control of these enterprises and lost the economic benefits of their traffic. Smaller towns withered as people and money flowed to larger cities. By 1900 the union that had emerged reflected the worst fears of railroad critics. The South and West had been settled, but wealth had flowed so heavily to the cities that rural life had lost its attraction. Passage to Union is compelling reading because Ms. Gordon has drawn from diaries, memoirs, literature, advertisements, newspapers and magazines, public records, and railroad history to construct her narrative. The impact of the railroads on people and their communities is powerfully illustrated in this absorbing story of apparent triumph and real loss.</p><h2>Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million</h2><p>Koba the Dread : Laughter and the Twenty Million</p><p>A brilliant weave of personal involvement, vivid biography and political insight, "Koba the Dread is the successor to Martin Amis's award-winning memoir, "Experience. <br>"Koba the Dread captures the appeal of one of the most powerful belief systems of the 20th century -- one that spread through the world, both captivating it and staining it red. It addresses itself to the central lacuna of 20th-century thought: the indulgence of Communism by the intellectuals of the West. In between the personal beginnings and the personal ending, Amis gives us perhaps the best one-hundred pages ever written about Stalin: Koba the Dread, Iosif the Terrible. <br>The author's father, Kingsley Amis, though later reactionary in tendency, was a "Comintern dogsbody" (as he would come to put it) from 1941 to 1956. His second-closest, and then his closest friend (after the death of the poet Philip Larkin), was Robert Conquest, our leading Sovietologist whose book of 1968, "The Great Terror, was second only to Solzhenitsyn's "The Gulag Archipelago in undermining the USSR. The present memoir explores these connections. <br>Stalin said that the death of one person was tragic, the death of a million a mere "statistic." "Koba the Dread, during whose course the author absorbs a particular, a familial death, is a rebuttal of Stalin's aphorism. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>&#x201c;<b>Koba the Dread</b> is filled with passion and intelligence, and with prose that gleams and startles. . . .This fierce little book. . .

Hugo Award-winning author Egan returns to the field with Incandescence, a new novel of hard SF.<br>The Amalgam spans nearly the entire galaxy, and is composed of innumerable beings from a wild variety of races, some human or near it, some entirely other. The one place that they cannot go is the bulge, the bright, hot center of the galaxy. There dwell the Aloof, who for millions of years have deflected any and all attempts to communicate with or visit them. So when Rakesh is offered an opportunity to travel within their sphere, in search of a lost race, he cannot turn it down.<br>Roi is a member of that lost race, which is not only lost to the Amalgam, but lost to itself.

People in the Amalgam exist indefinitely in digital form, able to assume any race when they are &#x201c;embodied,&#x201d; millennia passing as if only hours. The only unknown is the bulge, home to the Aloof, who resist all communications. Rakesh, who has fruitlessly searched for something new, cannot pass up the opportunity to enter the bulge when a stranger asks him to locate a lost race. Paralleling Rakesh&#x2019;s investigation is the story of that lost race, a collective of drones with no knowledge of themselves and their world. That changes when two citizens wake from dormancy, sparking an epidemic of scientific discovery that ultimately will save their world. The driving forces of this novel are a pure scientific puzzle and the intellectual joy of finding answers; Egan wastes little effort on character and conflict. Those who like their science hard will appreciate his thorough research and intricate speculations. --Krista Hutley</p><h2>Subway Style: 100 Years of Architecture &amp; Design in the New York City Subway</h2><p>More than 250 extraordinary photographs--including both newly commissioned color photographs and period images from the New York Transit Museum archives--chronicle one hundred years of architectural and design history from the New York City subway system, including everything from the interiors of the trains and architectural details of the stations to the development of the token and mosaic signage. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Unlikely as it may seem, the 100th anniversary of the New York City subway system was the impetus for a handsome book, <i>Subway Style: 100 Years of Architecture &amp; Design in the New York City Subway</i>. Produced by the New York Transit Museum, this abundantly illustrated design history traces the origins and development of subway cars and stations, including ceramic and metalwork detailing, ticket booths, signage, route maps and advertising. Treated in a merely dutiful way, this material would probably be of interest only to subway buffs. But <i>Subway Style</i> boasts high-quality photographs, an inviting design, and a succinct and wryly amusing text that relates subway developments to other cultural happenings and isn't too proud to explain specialized terms. It's the kind of book that makes the evolution of turnstiles sound fascinating. With a contractual mandate to instill "beauty" into "a great public work," the IRT--the first of three subway lines--originally featured elaborate Beaux Arts ceramic detailing displaying historical scenes or symbolizing local landmarks. Gracious bronze grilles served as ticket windows, and station names were painstakingly spelled out in glass mosaic tiles. Succeeding generations morphed these features into increasingly streamlined versions utilizing the latest technology and design trends. Wood station seats gave way to cast terrazzo perches cantilevered from the wall, then to molded fiberglass, polyurethane and finally back to wood. Usable maps were a long time in coming. In 1958, 18 years after the three lines were united, the Transit Authority finally published a single guide showing the entire system. Massimo Vignelli--whose bold, color-keyed station signage was a major innovation--later produced an abstract, all but useless map that was, as the book says, "emblematic of New York&#x2019;s 1970s retreat from urban life." The chapter on subway ads is (naturally) the most fun, ranging from Amelia Opdyke "Oppy" Jones' expressive cartoon characters--caught in the act of dropping gum wrappers or propping their feet on the seats--to head shots of women hoping to be voted "Miss Subways." <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis<i></i></i>The NEW YORK TRANSIT MUSEUM is one of only a handful of museums in the world dedicated to urban public transportation. The Museum's collections of objects, documents, photographs, films, and historic rolling stock illustrate the story of mass transit's critical role in the region's economic and residential development since the beginning of the 20th century. The Transit Museum's main facility is located in a decommissioned 1936 subway station in Brooklyn Heights, an ideal setting for the Museum's 20 vintage subway and elevated cars, and wide-ranging educational programs for children and adults. A gallery annex in Grand Central Terminal presents changing exhibits relevant to the millions of commuters who use mass transit every day.<br><br>Photographer Andrew Garn has exhibited his work in galleries around New York City and across the country. His photographs are also held in numerous museum and private collections.</p><h2>The Cafe Cook Book: Italian Recipes from London&#39;s River Cafe</h2><p>With their innovative interpretation of Italian country cooking, Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers have made London's legendary River Cafe one of the most influential and popular restaurants in the world. Their first book, <b>Rogers Gray Italian Country Cookbook</b>, was an international bestseller. Now, in <b>The Cafe Cook Book,</b> they provide more than 200 sensational new recipes in the vibrant, accessible style that has become their trademark.<br><br>Gray and Rogers continue to provide fresh interpretations of Italian cuisine, and in this new book, their enthusiasm for roasting in a wood oven takes center stage. Home cooks can create the same results by roasting meats, fish, vegetables, or fruits at a high temperature on the lowest rack of the oven or by slow roasting over a longer period of time. With these techniques, flavors become more intense, concentrated, and delicious: Pumpkin wedges with thyme. Radicchio wrapped in pancetta. Turbot or monkfish with capers. Baked loin of tuna with coriander. Chicken pan-roasted with milk and marjoram. Crisp, thin-crusted pizza. Rustic, country-style bread. Apricot, nectarine, and plum bruschetta. Baked pears with valpolicella.<br><br>In addition, favorite recipes from the River Cafe include seasonal fruit drinks, antipasti, pastas, risotto, soups, ice creams, and desserts. <b>The Cafe Cook Book</b> is essential for everyone who loved the first book as well as for those who have yet to discover this irresistible style of cooking.</p><p>At The River Caf�, chefs Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers serve dishes inspired by Italy's rustic regional cooking. In traditional Italian dishes, Prosciutto and Radicchio with Balsamic Vinegar and Wood-Roasted Asparagus, for example, they demonstrate the felicitous minimalism of fine Italian food. Lemon Risotto, livened with basil and mascarpone cheese, and Pigeons Braised in Red Wine, seasoned with chile, cumin, and Dijon mustard prove how these chefs are also creative. Most recipes in this book are short and simple; for Tagliatelle with Walnut Sauce, just pound the sauce ingredients together in a mortar and boil the pasta. However, dishes like Rise e Bisi, Risotto studded with green peas and seasoned with fresh mint, and most of the others in this book, require impeccable ingredients. If you go after them, you can turn out dishes as breathtakingly flavorful as those earning raves from London diners and restaurant critics; if you do not, the results will taste pleasing but not stunningly special. Martyn Thompson's many magnificent color photos of the food by Gray and Rogers are so precisely vivid and engaging that they recall work by Irving Penn. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i>Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers founded London's River Cafe in 1987. Their first book, <b>Rogers Gray Italian Country Cookbook,</b> was an instant bestseller and won both the Glenfiddich Food Book of the Year and the BCA Illustrated Book of the Year awards.</p><h2>The Minority Report</h2><p>In the world of <i>The Minority Report, </i>Commissioner John Anderton is the one to thank for the lack of crime. He is the originator of the Precrime System, which uses "precogs"--people with the power to see into the future--to identify criminals before they can do any harm. Unfortunately for Anderton, his precogs perceive <i>him </i>as the next criminal. But Anderton knows he has never contemplated such a thing, and this knowledge proves the precogs are fallible. Now, whichever way he turns, Anderton is doomed--unless he can find the precogs's "minority report"--the dissenting voice that represents his one hope of getting at the truth in time to save himself from his own system.<br><br>A film version of <i>The Minority Report</i>, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise, will be released this summer&#x2013;further proof of the enduring appeal of Philip K. Dick's visionary fiction.</p><p>Philip K. Dick was born in Chicago in 1928 and lived most of his life in California. He briefly attended the University of California, but dropped out before completing any classes. In 1952 he began writing professionally and proceeded to write thirty-six novels and five short story collections. He won the Hugo Award for best novel in 1962 for <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for <i>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.</i> Philip K. Dick died of heart failure following a stroke on March 2, 1982, in Santa Ana, California.The first thought Anderton had when he saw the young man was: <i>I'm getting bald. Bald and fat and old</i>. But he didn't say it aloud. Instead, he pushed back his chair, got to his feet, and came resolutely around the side of his desk, his right hand rigidly extended. Smiling with forced amiability, he shook hands with the young man.<br><br>"Witwer?" he asked, managing to make this query sound gracious.<br><br>"That's right," the young man said. "But the name's Ed to you, of course. That is, if you share my dislike for needless formality." The look on his blond, overly-confident face showed that he considered the matter settled. It would be Ed and John: Everything would be agreeably cooperative right from the start.<br><br>"Did you have much trouble finding the building?" Anderton asked guardedly, ignoring the too-friendly overture. <i>Good God, he had to hold on to something</i>. Fear touched him and he began to sweat. Witwer was moving around the office as if he already owned it--as if he were measuring it for size. Couldn't he wait a couple of days--a decent interval?<br><br>"No trouble," Witwer answered blithely, his hands in his pockets. Eagerly, he examined the voluminous files that lined the wall. "I'm not coming into your agency blind, you understand. I have quite a few ideas of my own about the way Precrime is run."<br><br>Shakily, Anderton lit his pipe. "How is it run? I should like to know."<br><br>"Not badly," Witwer said. "In fact, quite well."<br><br>Anderton regarded him steadily. "Is that your private opinion? Or is it just cant?"<br><br>Witwer met his gaze guilelessly. "Private and public. The Senate's pleased with your work. In fact, they're enthusiastic." He added, "As enthusiastic as very old men can be."<br><br>Anderton winced, but outwardly he remained impassive. It cost him an effort, though. He wondered what Witwer <i>really</i> thought. What was actually going on in that closecropped skull? The young man's eyes were blue, bright-and disturbingly clever. Witwer was nobody's fool. And obviously he had a great deal of ambition.<br><br>"As I understand it," Anderton said cautiously, "you're going to be my assistant until I retire."<br><br>"That's my understanding, too," the other replied, without an instant's hesitation.<br><br>"Which may be this year, or next year--or ten years from now." The pipe in Anderton's hand trembled. "I'm under no compulsion to retire. I founded Precrime and I can stay on here as long as I want. It's purely <i>my</i> decision."<br><br>Witwer nodded, his expression still guileless. "Of course."<br><br>With an effort, Anderton cooled down a trifle. "I merely wanted to get things straight."<br><br>"From the start," Witwer agreed. "You're the boss. What you say goes." With every evidence of sincerity, he asked: "Would you care to show me the organization? I'd like to familiarize myself with the general routine as soon as possible."<br><br>As they walked along the busy, yellow-lit tiers of offices, Anderton said: "You're acquainted with the theory of precrime, of course. I presume we can take that for granted."<br><br>"I have the information publicly available," Witwer replied. "With the aid of your precog mutants, you've boldly and successfully abolished the postcrime punitive system of jails and fines. As we all realize, punishment was never much of a deterrent, and could scarcely have afforded comfort to a victim already dead."<br><br>They had come to the descent lift. As it carried them swiftly downward, Anderton said: "You've probably grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We're taking in individuals who have broken no law."<br><br>"But they surely will," Witwer affirmed with conviction.<br><br>"Happily they <i>don't</i>--because we get them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We claim they're culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they're innocent. And, in a sense, they <i>are</i> innocent."<br><br>The lift let them out, and they again paced down a yellow corridor. "In our society we have no major crimes," Anderton went on, "but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals."<br><br>Doors opened and closed, and they were in the analytical wing. Ahead of them rose impressive banks of equipment--the data-receptors, and the computing mechanisms that studied and restructured the incoming material. And beyond the machinery sat the three precogs, almost lost to view in the maze of wiring.<br><br>"There they are," Anderton said dryly. "What do you think of them?"<br><br>In the gloomy half-darkness the three idiots sat babbling. Every incoherent utterance, every random syllable, was analyzed, compared, reassembled in the form of visual symbols, transcribed on conventional punchcards, and ejected into various coded slots. All day long the idiots babbled, imprisoned in their special high-backed chairs, held in one rigid position by metal bands, and bundles of wiring, clamps. Their physical needs were taken care of automatically. They had no spiritual needs. Vegetable-like, they muttered and dozed and existed. Their minds were dull, confused, lost in shadows.<br><br>But not the shadows of today. The three gibbering, fumbling creatures, with their enlarged heads and wasted bodies, were contemplating the future. The analytical machinery was recording prophecies, and as the three precog idiots talked, the machinery carefully listened.<br><br>For the first time Witwer's face lost its breezy confidence. A sick, dismayed expression crept into his eyes, a mixture of shame and moral shock. "It's not--pleasant," he murmured. "I didn't realize they were so--" He groped in his mind for the right word, gesticulating. "So--deformed."<br><br>"Deformed and retarded," Anderton instantly agreed. "Especially the girl, there. Donna is forty-five years old. But she looks about ten. The talent absorbs everything; the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area. But what do we care? We get their prophecies. They pass on what we need. They don't understand any of it, but <i>we</i> do."<br><br>Subdued, Witwer crossed the room to the machinery. From a slot he collected a stack of cards. "Are these names that have come up?" he asked.<br><br>"Obviously." Frowning, Anderton took the stack from him. "I haven't had a chance to examine them," he explained, impatiently concealing his annoyance.<br><br>Fascinated, Witwer watched the machinery pop a fresh card into the now empty slot. It was followed by a second--and a third. From the whirring disks came one card after another. "The precogs must see quite far into the future," Witwer exclaimed.<br><br>"They see a quite limited span," Anderton informed him. "One week or two ahead at the very most. Much of their data is worthless to us--simply not relevant to our line. We pass it on to the appropriate agencies. And they in turn trade data with us. Every important bureau has its cellar of treasured <i>monkeys</i>."<br><br>"Monkeys?" Witwer stared at him uneasily. "Oh, yes, I understand. See no evil, speak no evil, et cetera. Very amusing."<br><br>"Very <i>apt</i>." Automatically, Anderton collected the fresh cards which had been turned up by the spinning machinery. "Some of these names will be totally discarded. And most of the remainder record petty crimes: thefts, income tax evasion, assault, extortion. As I'm sure you know, Precrime has cut down felonies by ninety-nine and decimal point eight percent. We seldom get actual murder or treason. After all, the culprit knows we'll confine him in the detention camp a week before he gets a chance to commit the crime."<br><br>"When was the last time an actual murder was committed?" Witwer asked.<br><br>"Five years ago," Anderton said, pride in his voice.<br><br>"How did it happen?"<br><br>"The criminal escaped our teams. We had his name-in fact, we had all the details of the crime, including the victim's name. We knew the exact moment, the location of the planned act of violence. But in spite of us he was able to carry it out." Anderton shrugged. "After all, we can't get all of them." He riffled the cards. "But we do get most."<br><br>"One murder in five years." Witwer's confidence was returning. "Quite an impressive record . . . something to be proud of."<br><br>Quietly Anderton said: "I <i>am</i> proud. Thirty years ago I worked out the theory-back in the days when the self-seekers were thinking in terms of quick raids on the stock market. I saw something legitimate ahead-something of tremendous social value."<br><br>He tossed the packet of cards to Wally Page, his subordinate in charge of the monkey block. "See which ones we want," he told him. "Use your own judgment."<br><br>As Page disappeared with the cards, Witwer said thoughtfully: "It's a big responsibility."<br><br>"Yes, it is," agreed Anderton. "If we let one criminal escape--as we did five years ago--we've got a human life on our conscience. We're solely responsible. If we slip up, somebody dies." Bitterly, he jerked three new cards from the slot. "It's a public trust."<br><br>"Are you ever tempted to--" Witwer hesitated. "I mean, some of the men you pick up must offer you plenty."<br><br>"It wouldn't do any good. A duplicate file of cards pops out at Army GHQ. It's check and balance. They can keep their eye on us as continuously as they wish." Anderton glanced briefly at the top card. "So even if we wanted to accept a--"<br><br>He broke off, his lips tightening.<br><br>"What's the matter?" Witwer asked...</p><h2>Whole Woman Homeopathy: A Safe, Effective, Natural Alternative to Drugs, Hormones and Surgery</h2><p>A comprehensive, practical, user-friendly guide to homeopathic care for women.

With a heady mix of pop culture, provocative iconography, political satire, ethnic stereotypes and guerrilla theory, he explores "the territory of cultural misunderstanding."</p><p>"In everything he does, he remains an indomitably playful phrasemaker; a fertile rethinker of cultural contradictions, clich�s, and conundrums; and an inspiring recruiter for a playground army of cultural pluralists."&#x2014;<em>The Village Voice</em></p><p>"G�mez-Pe�a invites the reader into uncharted territory: the vast, intercontinental border zone where people live between and across cultures and countries, creating a thoroughly hybrid society where the only cultural "others" are those who stubbornly resist "mestizaje". <em>The New World Border</em> is both wildly entertaining and thoughtfully incisive, inducing a kind of cultural vertigo that erases the borders between 'us' and 'them'. <em>The New World Border</em> is a required addition to all literary and multicultural studies collections!"&#x2014;<em>Midwest Book Review</em></p><p>"Guillermo G�mez Pe�a is a clear example of the work that originates from and about the border. His work deals with borders, with their existence, construction, reconstruction, definition, and eventual questioning. In this context, the aim of this essay is to explore the way the artist puts into practice his conceptualization of the border reality in The New World Border: Prophecies for the End of the Century, which toured worldwide and in front of very diverse, international audiences."&#x2014;Amaia Ibarraran Bigalondo, <em>Journal of Contemporary Drama in English</em></p></p><p>If writing about music is like dancing about architecture, then a book about performance art is surely like a sonata about sculpture. In the case of <i>The New World Border</i>, however, there is little lost in translation; the force and originality of Guillermo G�mez-Pe�a's ideas come across loud and clear. Billed as "chicano cyber-punk art," his work revolves around the disorienting reality of living in a multilingual, multicultural society. To express the inherent confusion of colliding cultures, he creates a fictional nation called Aztlan Liberado, where various identities, races, genders, and languages all blend to create an amalgamated society. In this world, the language is Spanglish, all borders have been removed, and whites are the minority. He writes a series of news reports on this theme that turn clich�s inside out and point stereotypes the other way: "In an act of random violence, two unemployed corporate executives walked into a luxurious Taco Bell Bistro and fired upon the peaceful fajita-eating customers. Today's headline in the minority paper, the <i>New York Times</i>, reads: 'Blood and guacamole all over walls; a macabre scene.'"<p> Another piece uses text and photographs to describe an act performed in Europe and the U.S. Here, G�mez-Pe�a places himself in a small gilded or bamboo cage in the middle of a busy plaza or shopping mall and presents himself as an "exotic multicultural specimen" who can be "activated" by shoppers who want to witness his "incredible ethnic talents." Such talents include modeling traditional Indian garb, doing commercials for organic products, and "posing in attitudes of martyrdom, despair, and poverty"--essentially behaving in any way that spectators expect their "primitives" to act--allowing G�mez-Pe�a to make a statement about how cultural identities are often presented as commodities.</p><p> This American Book Award-winning collection of essays, poems, performance texts, photographs, and "prophesies for the coming century" is by turns outlandish, illuminating, wickedly clever, and unabashedly serious. A frenetic artist, satirist, and phrasemaker, G�mez-Pe�a is able to convey the electricity and inventiveness of his live shows through heavy doses of humor, irony, and word play. G�mez-Pe�a's aim is to establish a common middle ground among North Americans; until a seamless North America becomes a reality, however, G�mez-Pe�a will continue to live on the border--and would like to see us all there. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>Guillermo G�mez-Pe�a was born in Mexico City in 1955 and came to the U.S. in 1978. His work, which includes performance art, poetry, journalism, criticism and cultural theory, explores cross-cultural issues and North/South relations. He is the recipient of an American Book Award for <em>The New World Border</em> and a MacArthur Foundation Genius Award, among many other honors. One of his other works, <em>Codex Espangliensis</em>, was also published by City Lights Publishers.</p></p><h2>Send Yourself Roses: My Life, Loves and Leading Roles: And Other Ways to Take the Lead in Life</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT</p><h2>Michael Bloomfield: The Rise and Fall of an American Guitar Hero</h2><p><b>Nominated for the 2017&nbsp;ARSC Award for Excellence in Historical Recorded Sound Research</b><br><br> This is the definitive biography of the legendary guitarist whom eminent figures like Muddy Waters and B. B. King held in high esteem, and who created the prototype for Clapton, Hendrix, Page, and everyone who followed.<br><br> Bloomfield was one of the first popular music superstars of the 1960s to earn his reputation almost entirely on his instrumental prowess. He was a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which inspired a generation of white blues players; he played with Bob Dylan in the mid-1960s, when his guitar was a central component of Dylan&#x2019;s new rock sound on &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone&#x201d; and at his earthshaking 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance. He then founded the Electric Flag, recorded&nbsp;<i>Super Session</i>&nbsp;with Al Kooper, backed Janis Joplin, and released at least twenty other albums, despite debilitating substance abuse. He died of a mysterious drug overdose in 1981.<br><br> A very limited edition of a book of this title was first published in 1983, but it has here been so thoroughly revised and expanded that it is essentially a brand-new publication. Based on extensive interviews with Bloomfield himself and with those who knew him best, and including an extensive discography and Bloomfield&#x2019;s memorable 1968 <i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;interview, <i>Michael Bloomfield </i>is an intimate portrait of one of the pioneers of rock guitar.</p><p><b>Ed Ward</b>&nbsp;has been the &#x201c;rock &amp; roll historian&#x201d; for Terry Gross and&nbsp;<i>Fresh Air</i>&nbsp;since that show&#x2019;s inception, and has contributed over 500 stories to it. He is also a founding director of the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference; wrote one-third of&nbsp;<i>Rock of Ages: The Rolling Stone History of Rock &amp; Roll</i>, in 1986; was the Central European cultural correspondent for the&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;for seven years; and was on one of the early staffs at&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>. He lives in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;<b>Billy F. Gibbons&nbsp;</b>is the guitarist and lead vocalist of ZZ Top. He lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;A riveting tale of a restless spirit.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br><br>"In this chronicle of a life found and lost, Ed Ward writes with deep empathy, and also with a hard-boiled patience that burns off all sentiment. It is the perfect tone for a story Ward never tries to make bigger than it is, so that finally it makes terrible and final sense." &#x2014;Greil Marcus, author of <i>The History of Rock 'n' Roll</i> <i>in Ten Songs</i> and <i>Mystery Train</i><br><br>"Michael Bloomfield was brilliant, troubled, flawed, charming, and dauntingly influential, and Ed Ward adeptly balances his strengths and weaknesses, creating a picture of a man who was all too in tune with a complicated time." &#x2014;Elijah Wald, author of <i>Dylan Goes Electric! </i>and <i>Escaping the Delta</i><br><br>&#x201c;[A] terrific book, which charts the course of Bloomfield's life and career with style, detail and insight.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Ed Ward tells Bloomfield&#x2019;s story in compelling fashion, often pointing to the great tracks people may not know about.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Counter Punch<br><br>"Michael Bloomfield was such a unique and mercurial character is was like handling hot coals in your mind. You should get to know him because the people that knew him, loved him. His guitar playing was beautiful. His heart and soul were as big as it gets. This remembrance brings to life the amazing story of a young Jewish kid from Chicago's North Side whose unique style of improvisational guitar led the world into the modern age of blues and rock. Hey, folks, he was historic." &#x2014;Nick Gravenites, singer and songwriter<br><br>"A brilliant biography of the ethereal Chicago blues guitar giant who shook the walls down in the '60s and '70s with his soaring art. There is a mother lode of fresh rock 'n' roll history in these pages. The discography alone is worth the price of admission. Highly recommended!" &#x2014;Douglas Brinkley, author of&nbsp;<i>Rightful Heritage&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Wilderness Warrior</i><br><br>&#x201c;As a biographer, Ward successfully conveys the complex story of a troubled Jew, who could shake a string like no one else.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tablet Magazine<br><br>"With all due respect to Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, and so many others who are in the pantheon of blues greats, in this white Jew's opinion, Michael Bloomfield was simply the best blues guitarist I've ever heard." &#x2014;Rob Reiner, filmmaker and actor</p><h2>Alienated</h2><p>Interplanetary relations have never been more exciting! The first in a funny, romantic YA sci-fi series.<br><br>Two years ago, the aliens made contact.

Cara's blog following is about to skyrocket.<br><br>Still, Cara isn't sure what to think when she meets Aelyx. Humans and L'eihrs have nearly identical DNA, but cold, infuriatingly brilliant Aelyx couldn't seem more alien.

Threatening notes appear in Cara's locker, and a police officer has to escort her and Aelyx to class.<br><br>Cara finds support in the last person she expected. She realizes that Aelyx isn't just her only friend; she's fallen hard for him. But Aelyx has been hiding the truth about the purpose of his exchange, and its potentially deadly consequences.

A proud sci-fi geek, she isn't afraid to wear her Princess Leia costume in public&#x2015;just ask her embarrassed kids. She lives outside Cincinnati in the small town of Milford Ohio, where she writes romantic space adventures for teens and the young at heart.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;In Alienated, Cara Sweeney, high school overachiever and class valedictorian, has been selected to host the first L'eihr exchange student. Initial excitement and pride are quickly overshadowed by doubt and unease upon meeting the alien Aelyx. Although almost genetically identical, the two cultures are as different as night and day and the level of discomfort is evident. Further complicating matters is anti-alien paranoia and violence directed not only at Aelyx and the other exchange students, but also at Cara and her family. Drawn together due to circumstance, the teens start falling for each other. In Invaded, the couple continues to try to forge an alliance between the two planets, as mutual survival of both populations are depending on it. Amid hate and an unknown future, Cara must decide between love, the unknown, and the future she always dreamed of having. Excellent character development and a nice integration between modern reality and science fiction drive the plot in a satisfying story arc. Continuation of the story line is seamless between series installments, giving readers a continued interest in and connection to the protagonists. Themes of racism and environmentalism are integral to understanding and developing the emotional level of the story as well as the momentum of the plot. Teens will be rooting for the galactic couple while enjoying the action and suspense that runs through the two volumes. A fun pick for fans of sci-fi with a bit of romance.&#x2014;Elizabeth Speer, Cisco College, TX</p><h2>Defending the Undefendable: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue&#39;s Gallery of American Society</h2><p>Just how far can the principles of individual liberty be pushed? Walter Block pushes them just as far as he can in defense of the activities of scallywags, rogues, rascals, and scoundrels. From the premise that activities involving force and fraud are outlawed, Block defends all of those "capitalist acts between consenting adults" that horrify right-thinking Americans by showing that they are actually beneficial. <p> "An outrageously funny yet ruthlessly logical book... If libertarians can't speak out forthrightly for individual freedom in unpopular areas, we haven't the courage of our alleged convictions. This book ought to be the cutting edge of the libertarian movement for years to come." -- D.T. Armentano </p><p> "Walter Block argues that some of the most socially offensive members of society--including prostitutes, libelers and moneylenders--are 'scapegoats' whose actual social and economic value is not being appreciated. Startling and illuminating! Block's lucid defenses often convince; sometimes they lead us to sharpen our attack. In either case, the reader cannot fail to be instructed and challenged by this mind-stretching, provocative, and occasionally infuriating book." -- Robert Nozick </p><p> "This witty and wonderful book is a veritable manual of the 'joy of freedom.' If we were only half as interested in liberty as in lust, we would not have half the problems we have." -- Dr. Thomas Szasz </p><p> "It is a magnificent book, a trailblazer. I would call it 'Drano for Clogged Minds,' except that Drano is neither amusing nor stimulating, and this book is both. Buy two copies--one for yourself and one for the person you want most to catch up with you." -- Roger Lea MacBride </p><p> "There are things that I strongly agree with and things that I strongly disagree with, but the book throughout is amusingly and sharply reasoned, courageous and always provocative." -- Henry Hazlitt </p><p> "<b>Defending the Undefendable</b> made me feel that I was once more exposed to the shock therapy by which, more than fifty years ago, the late Ludwig von Mises converted me to a consistent free-market position. Some may find it too strong a medicine, but it will still do them good even if they hate it." -- F.A. Hayek </p><p> "Until Prof. Block's book, no economist had the courage to tackle the moral and economic status of the dozens of reviled and misunderstood occupations in our society." -- Murray Rothbard</p></p><p></p><h2>Go with your Gut: The Insider&#39;s Guide to Banishing the Bloat with 75 Digestion-Friendly Recipes</h2><p><b>When nutritionist Robyn Youkilis began her coaching practice, she quickly realized that the vast majority of complaints she heard from clients were about their digestion.

The author tells of Israel&#39;s many secret agreements with America over the years, including the KH-11 satellite agreement which aided the bombing of Iraq&#39;s Osirak reactor in 1981, and the recruitment of Jonathan Pollard, Israel&#39;s first nuclear spy. He also reveals the truth behind Mossad&#39;s kidnapping of Mordecai Vanunu - the Israeli technician who broke the story of the Dimona reactor to the &#34;Sunday Times&#34; in 1986, only to be abducted in Rome and taken back to Israel to face trial. The book discloses how Vanunu was betrayed to the Israelis - and by whom.

In the process important connections to our past are lost. Seattle s First Hill certainly reflects this dynamic transformation. First Hill developed on a promontory east of downtown and became the location of important churches, clubs, hotels, schools, and residences for civic leaders and entrepreneurs from the 1890s until World War I. From Sixth Avenue to Broadway and from Pike Street to Yesler Way, streets were filled with stylish residences, boarding houses, and fraternal and ethnic community halls welcoming newcomers to the Northwest from America and abroad. Some buildings survive and others made way for a denser neighborhood of institutional and commercial buildings, apartment houses for every income level, and the center of Seattle s healthcare industry. This book traces First Hill s origins, explains how and why changes occurred, and points to the potential that exists for future development that respects its surviving historic buildings. Editor Lawrence Kreisman, Historic Seattle s Program Director, taps the knowledge and talents of local and regional historians and authors Paul Dorpat, Jacqueline Williams, Dotty DeCoster, Dennis Alan Andersen, Luci J. Baker Johnson, and Brooke Best for a publication whose chapters make visible the historical, cultural, and social dimensions of First Hill. The book is a marvelous starting point for urban understanding and exploration. We hope it will encourage longtime and newly settled residents, office workers, shoppers, concert and lecture attendees, and visitors to think about what makes this place special and worthy of preservation. First Hill architecture and culture are waiting to be discovered.</p><p>HISTORIC SEATTLE is a public development authority established by Seattle City ordinance in 1974. For 40 years, Historic Seattle has shown what can be done quietly, in the background, with technical assistance and feasibility studies, and loudly, by plunging into full-scale redevelopment of buildings that no one else in the community would assume responsibility to protect. Historic Seattle has tackled many challenging and inspiring projects on its own or in partnership with others. Its strength has been the ability to leverage its limited financial resources with government funding, grants, bank loans, and private investment in order to cover the construction and financing costs to save endangered buildings. Our organization actively seeks projects that will make a difference to the community.Tradition and Change on Seattle s First Hill by Lawrence Kreisman (Documentary Media, $34.95).

Mouw<br><br> Are Latter-day Saints Christian, or do they worship a different Jesus? In this engaging book based on the foundational Mormon documents, Robert Millet clearly explains why Latter-day Saints claim to be Christians and compares their understanding of Jesus with the views of traditional Christian believers.<br><br> A leading Mormon scholar who has spent much of his career in conversation with traditional Christians and their writings, Millet discusses what constitutes Christianity and examines how the Latter-day Saints fit or do not fit within that rubric. Intended to inform rather than to convince or persuade, <i>A Different Jesus?</i> clears away misconceptions and doctrinal distortions that characterize more polemical works about Mormonism. Millet points out the many beliefs that Latter-day Saints hold in common with traditional Christians, yet he also emphasizes differences where they exist.<br><br><i>A Different Jesus?</i> initiates and will foster a significant dialogue between Latter-day Saints and traditional Christians. Of special value are a lengthy chapter that answers some of the most frequently asked questions about Mormonism, a glossary showing how key theological terms are defined by Latter-day Saints, and evangelical scholar Richard Mouw's foreword and afterword, which help set an agenda for future discussions between these rich religious traditions.</p><p>Robert L. Millet is Richard L. Evans Professor of Religious Understanding and Professor of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.A humble, inviting foreword by evangelical Christian leader Richard Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary, sets the stage for this groundbreaking book by a Mormon scholar that compares LDS beliefs about Christ with traditional Protestant (and to a lesser extent, Catholic and Orthodox) views. Millet, a professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, has spent years in formal conversation with evangelical friends (including Mouw) and coming to understand their beliefs as he presented the LDS viewpoint. This book is offered in the same spirit of dialogue, with no traces of the smugness or shrill tone that often characterize apologetic works. After providing a brief overview of LDS origins and history, Millet offers the LDS perspective on knotty theological issues such as Jesus' premortal life, the reliability of the Bible, the need for a "restoration" of the New Testament church, the nature of humanity, the mechanics of salvation and the eternal fate of those who've never heard the gospel message. Millet is as at home in the writings of such evangelical heroes as C.S. Lewis, J.B. Phillips, John MacArthur and Max Lucado as he is in the teachings of LDS prophets like Joseph Smith, Brigham Young and Gordon Hinckley. The book's honest and searching tone is deepened still further by Mouw's gracious afterword, in which he respectfully identifies issues where he disagrees with his Mormon friend. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Also included is <em>A Short Organum for the Theatre</em>, Brecht's most complete statement of his revolutionary philosophy of the theatre.</p><p>This important volume offers a major selection of Bertolt Brecht&#39;s groundbreaking critical writing.<b>Bertolt Bertolt</b> (1898-1956) was the most influential German dramatist and theoretician of the theater in the 20th century. Also a poet of formidable gifts and considerable output, Brecht first attracted attention in the Berlin of the 1920s as the author of provocative plays that challenged the tenets of traditional theater. Forced to flee Germany in 1933 because of his leftist political beliefs and opposition to the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, Brecht and his family spent 14 years in exile in Scandinavia and the United States. Although he tried hard to become established in the United States, Brecht failed to make a breakthrough either as a scriptwriter in Hollywood, California, or as a playwright on Broadway. Two years later he moved to East Berlin and remained there until his death. In the 1950s he became an internationally acclaimed playwright and director through productions of his plays by the Berliner Ensemble, a company based in East Berlin and headed by his wife, actor Helene Weigel. <br><br><b>John Willett</b> (1917-2002) was a noted scholar, author and translator. From the outset he was the prime editor and translator (with Ralph Manheim and others) behind Brecht in English. He was involved in the planning and translation of the programme book for the Berliner Ensemble's celebrated first visit to London in 1956 (the year of Brecht's own death); in 1959 he published the first general study in any language, <i>The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht; </i>he translated, edited and introduced the enormously influential <i>Brecht on Theatre</i> (1964); and he was a founding member of the International Brecht Society and sometime editor of its Yearbook.<br></p><h2>Media and the American Mind: From Morse to McLuhan</h2><p>In a fascinating and comprehensive intellectual history of modern communication in America, Daniel Czitrom examines the continuing contradictions between the progressive possibilities that new communications technologies offer and their use as instruments of domination and exploitation.<br><br></p><p>"Czitrom has produced a significant work that should be read by all scholars interested in the historical forces that have shaped modern American society."-- <i>American Historical Review</i> <br>Daniel J.

If I had known how being &#x2018;bad&#x2019; would be part of his charm and would add to his success on camera, I might have given this more thought." &#x2014; Dick Wolfsie<br><br>Television reporter Dick Wolfsie was walking out his front door on the way to the studio one wintry morning when he found a shivering beagle pup on his front steps. Dick placed the stray inside the house and was off to work. When he returned four hours later, his wife and young son were cleaning up what remained of the shredded couch, the living room curtains, and his wife&#x2019;s favorite high heels.<br>The family would soon demand that Dick either take the dog to work with him each day or find the troublemaker a minimum security facility. So, off to the station they went. Ultimately this naughty pup nosed his way in front of the camera with Dick. Soon the dynamic duo would make TV history.<br><br>For ten years&#x2014;more than 2,500 morning news shows&#x2014;fans watched the renegade pooch chew, howl, and dig his way through every one of Dick&#x2019;s reports.

The former high school psychology teacher is also a syndicated newspaper columnist and author of eleven books. He lives in Indianapolis with his wife, Mary Ellen, and his son, Brett, and his second beagle, Toby. Oh, and Angel, the cat.<br>Syndicated humor columnist Wolfsie pens an insightful and delightfully unsentimental biography of his dog, Barney, who became a legendary figure in central Indiana. When Wolfsie was a television feature reporter during the 1970s, he awoke one morning to the sounds of a howling stray beagle. After taking him in&#x2014;and coming home from work to find that the dog had shredded a good deal of his house&#x2014;Wolfsie began taking the newly named Barney to work with him, where his on- and off-set antics became the hit of the show, leading to a new "human/canine team" whose adventures lasted for more than a decade (the station management especially liked it when Barney, on-air, relieved himself on a competing station's advertising). Barney appeared at schools and state fairs, fulfilling the mission that Wolfsie describes as the unique ability "to touch lives." In the end, while it is deeply moving when Barney dies, it is sadder still&#x2014;for both author and reader&#x2014;as Wolfsie cogently observes how corporate cutbacks in news operations have ended the era when such features as the onscreen antics of a lovable beagle were an integral part of local newscasts. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Studies of his Art and his life fill the shelves of libraries. Yet for all this accessibility, an air of uncertainty has always clouded his image. Since Morris&#39;s death, biographers and scholars have portrayed the artist as a victim, bound to an adulterous wife. In Art and Forbidden Fruit, John Le Bourgeois lifts this veil of appearances, and shows the truth about Morris&#39;s life. In a close analysis of Morris&#39;s poetry and biography, the author asserts the early existence of an emotional attachment between William Morris and his sister Emma, and how she became the principal source of his inspiration. Le Bourgeois follows the paths of Morris the artist and Morris the man, and points out the links between the poet&#39;s love for his sister and his evolution as an artist. Art and Forbidden Fruit provides a highly original biography of William Morris that offers a new perspective on his life and a fresh interpretation of his art by a specialist.</p><p>Quentin performed his PhD study within the research project Ancestral Mounds.In his research he dealt with groups of barrows and their position within the landscape.

The first novel in this trilogy-her acclaimed, hugely successful Two from Galilee-told the great love story of Mary and Joseph as never before. <br><br> Now, in <i>Three from Galilee</i>, Holmes's fictionalized retelling of the life of Jesus covers a period overlooked by the Gospels-the "lost years" between age 12, when Jesus debated the elders in the temple, to the age of 30, when he actually began his ministry. With great reverence, she dares to wonder what Jesus did during those years, if he was like other young men of his time, and whether he experienced God's greatest gift to humanity-love. Using her remarkable talents, Holmes brings Jesus, his parents, brothers, sisters, and friends to life in a story that is dramatic, deeply moving, and unforgettable.</p><p>From Marjorie Holmes, one of the most beloved authors of our times, comes the stunning story you have been asking for, the inspiring sequel to her national bestseller, <i>Two From Galilee</i>...<i>Three From Galilee</i>.<p></p><p>Rooted in her broad knowledge of the Bible and of history, Marjorie's wonderful new novel explores the "lost years" of Jesus' young manhood-a period not even mentioned in the Bible. Where did he go and what did he do between the age of twelve, when we last see him debating the elders in the temple, and the age of thirty, when he began his ministry? What were those years like for Mary? Was her son as human as his brothers? Was it possible that he, too, could fall in love? With great reverence, Marjorie Holmes employs her remarkable talent for vividly recreating characters and background to bring Jesus, his parents, brothers, sisters, and friends to sparkling life. <i>Three From Galilee</i> is a dramatic, deeply moving, and unforgettable story.</p>Marjorie Holmes was born in Iowa, where she graduated from Cornell College in 1931. She moved to the Washington area, where she wrote columns for the <i>Washington Star</i> and <i>Woman's Day</i> magazine, and also taught university-level writing courses.

The arrival of the famous author caused the usual stir&#x2014;but then Twain took off his overcoat to reveal a "snow-white" tailored suit and scandalized the room. His shocking outfit appalled and delighted his contemporaries, but far more than that, as Pulitzer Prize finalist Michael Shelden shows in this wonderful new biography, Twain had brilliantly staged this act of showmanship to cement his image, and his personal legend, in the public's imagination. That afternoon in Washington, less than four years before his death, marked the beginning of a vibrant, tumultuous period in Twain's life that would shape much of the now-famous image by which he has come to be known&#x2014;America's indomitable icon, the Man in White.<br><br>Although Mark Twain has long been one of our most beloved literary figures&#x2014;Time magazine has declared him "our original superstar"&#x2014;his final years have been largely misunderstood. Despite family tragedies, Twain's last&nbsp;half- decade was among the most dynamic periods in the author's life. With the spirit and vigor of a man fifty years younger, he continued to stir up trouble, perfecting his skill for living large. Writing ceaselessly and always ready with one of his legendary quips, Twain would risk his fortune, become the willing victim of a lost-at-sea hoax, and pick fights with King Leopold of Belgium and Mary Baker Eddy.<br><br>Drawing on a number of unpublished sources, including Twain's own journals, letters, and a revealing four-hundred-page personal account kept under wraps for decades (and still yet to be published),<b> Mark Twain: Man in White</b> brings the legendary author's twilight years vividly to life, offering surprising insights, including an intimate, tender look at his family life. Filled with first-rate scholarship, rare and never-published Twain photos, delightful anecdotes, and memorable quotes, including numerous recovered Twainisms, this definitive biography of Twain's last years<i> </i>provides a remarkable portrait of the man himself and of the unforgettable era in American letters that, in many ways, he helped to create.</p><p>Michael Shelden is the author of three previous biographies, including Orwell, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. He was a correspondent for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> (London) and a critic for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. He is currently a professor of English at Indiana State University.<i>Part One<br><br>Blithe Spirit<br><br>Chapter One<br>Ragtime on Tap<br><br>Many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising.<br><br></i><br>On the final night of 1906 the fog was so heavy in Manhattan that even the powerful new searchlight shining over Times Square could barely penetrate it. Rain had been falling all day, and the sidewalks were full of frustrated revelers huddled under umbrellas. But as midnight approached, the air cleared a little, the moon came out, and the searchlight broke through the clouds, projecting a glowing "1907" against the black sky. In the distance, factory whistles blared as thousands of partygoers broke into cheers and the restaurants on Broadway dimmed their lights. Crowds poured into Times Square throwing confetti, shaking cowbells, and blowing toy horns.<br><br>A few blocks away&#x2014;inside the cavernous hall of the New York Electric Music Company&#x2014;the street celebrations were drowned out by the sound of "Auld Lang Syne" being played on an enormous new device called a Telharmonium. Weighing two hundred tons, and requiring more than two thousand electrical switches to amplify its notes, the organlike instrument was undergoing the first major test of its capability to transmit music through telephone lines to listening stations around town. Though it was a crude effort to do what radio broadcasts would later do much better, the invention was greeted as a great technological breakthrough, and there was talk that it would soon be available to anyone with ordinary telephone service. For its New Year's Eve demonstration, lines were connected to large megaphones at several caf�s and hotels. The only private residence to receive the transmission was Mark Twain's tall corner house at 21 Fifth Avenue&#x2014;near Washington Square&#x2014;where twenty guests were invited to listen to the Telharmonium's music fill his parlor a few minutes before the stroke of twelve.<br><br>Just before the special equipment began to reverberate with sound, Twain gathered his audience around him, paused dramatically, and then commanded, "Listen." As if by magic, the music began to pour from the megaphone. The author's face lit up, and he stepped aside to allow his guests to appreciate this modern wonder. In a letter written the next day, he proudly described the moment: "At 11:55 there was a prepared surprise; lovely music&#x2014;played on a silent piano of 300 keys at the corner of Broadway a mile and a half away, and sent over the telephone wire to our parlor&#x2014;the first time this marvelous invention ever uttered its voice in a private house."<br><br>It seemed a dream come true to a man who counted among his most cherished possessions a massive player organ encased in an eight-foot-high mahogany frame. He was so fond of his "Aeolian Orchestrelle" that he used it almost every night&#x2014;playing a simple melody on the keyboard himself or listening to something from his collection of sixty music rolls. His favorites were Beethoven sonatas and Chopin nocturnes, but he also liked popular songs and Scottish airs. Now he could look forward to having the wizards of the New York Electric Music Company supply him with tunes of all kinds on demand, making available&#x2014;in the words of the Telharmonium's supporters&#x2014;"opera, symphony and ragtime on tap."2<br><br>He had first heard of the Telharmonium only two weeks earlier when he came across a newspaper article about it. He was so thrilled by the report that he had gone straight to the company's headquarters at Thirty-ninth and Broadway&#x2014;across the street from the Metropolitan Opera House&#x2014;to see the device for himself.<br><br>A reporter had tagged along and watched as Twain sat near the keyboard dais of the massive instrument, swinging his legs while he listened contentedly to a private demonstration. The quality of the sound pleased him, but what really fascinated him was the sheer mechanical complexity of the device, whose workings seemed almost beyond comprehension. Eagerly, he agreed on the spot to take out the first individual subscription to the new service. Later, he proudly declared that this put him once again at the forefront of modern technological progress, noting that he had been among the first to use a fountain pen, a typewriter, and a home telephone.<br><br>The one regret he expressed was that the device had not been invented sooner. "The trouble about these beautiful, novel things," he remarked, "is that they interfere so with one's arrangements. Every time I see or hear a new wonder like this I have to postpone my death right off. I couldn't possibly leave the world until I have heard this again and again."3<br><br>For his New Year's Eve celebration, he allowed half a dozen reporters into his home to observe the festivities. In the front hall they gathered with notebooks in hand and listened politely as he explained the wonders of his new musical device. But everyone seemed to understand that the main attraction of the evening wasn't the workings of the new machine but the antics of the old man in white. He didn't disappoint the men of the press. Striking a pose, he declared, "This is the famous suit I wore when I went to interview the copyright committee of Congress in Washington. Yes, I insist that white is the best color for men's clothes. If men were not so near insane they would appreciate the fact."<br><br>One reporter teased him about his fame, suggesting that he run for governor. He pretended to take the idea seriously. "I am the real man," he shot back. "I am sure I would make a great Governor." While he was talking, a small wagon was wheeled into the parlor behind his back. It was carrying "a bewhiskered old gentleman" who was supposed to represent 1906. "There he comes butting in," Twain joked, looking behind him. "He doesn't know when to quit."4<br><br>The party had a circuslike atmosphere, with the host presiding over various games and comic skits throughout the evening. Twain wanted his guests to be in high spirits when they were treated to the first magical notes from the Telharmonium. At one point he wandered off for a short time, and then suddenly reappeared at the top of the stairs with a young man whose arm was tied to his by a pink ribbon. In identical white suits, they descended the stairs slowly, each trying to match the steps of the other but not quite succeeding. As they entered the parlor, Twain announced that they were Siamese twins and were going to enlighten the guests by presenting a lecture on the evils of strong drink. While the older "brother" explained the dangers of liquor, the younger stood silently and took furtive drinks from a flask of rum.<br><br>As some of the guests may have known, P. T. Barnum's famous conjoined twins&#x2014;Chang and Eng&#x2014;used to have violent arguments with each other over religion and alcohol. So Mark and his twin pretended that the drinking habits of one affected the sobriety of the other. The more Mark denounced rum, the more intoxicated he became, staggering and hiccupping and slurring his words as his other half finished off the contents of the flask.<br><br>Twain was in rare form, playing his part effortlessly and behaving like a much younger man. "We are so much to each other, my brother and I," he explained, as he pretended to succumb slowly to the effects of alcohol, "that what nourishes him and what he drinks&#x2014;ahem!&#x2014;nourishes me. . . . It has often been a source of considerable annoyance to me, when going about the country lecturing on temperance, to find myself at the head of a procession . . . so drunk I couldn't see."<br><br>His guests laughed so hard that he was forced to end his mock lecture because he couldn't be heard above the noise. In a front-page story the next day, the New York Times began its report of the party by going along with Twain's joke, declaring, "The last thing that Mark Twain did in 1906 was to get drunk and deliver a lecture on temperance. . . . [He] took all the glory for the lecture to himself while he blamed his Siamese brother for the jag. Those who have never heard that Mr. Clemens has a Siamese brother, must be told that he only had such a relative for one night."5<br><br>This "partially impromptu performance" was inspired by an idea that had been at the back of Twain's mind for years. In the 1890s he had written "Those Extraordinary Twins," which features conjoined brothers who are at odds over everything&#x2014;one is a hard-drinking Democrat, the other a Whig champion of the Teetotalers' League. But his first treatment of such a farcical pairing goes all the way back to a short piece called "Personal Habits of the Siamese Twins," which was written in the late 1860s, when Chang and Eng were at the height of their fame.<br><br>Pretending to be an intimate friend of the famous pair, Twain claimed to know all their secrets. It was true that one brother was a temperance man and the other was not, but Twain added the outrageous charge that the two had been bitter enemies in the Civil War. "During the War they were strong partisans," he wrote, "and both fought gallantly all through the great struggle&#x2014;Eng on the Union side and Chang on the Confederate. They took each other prisoners at Seven Oaks."6<br><br>This was the sort of comedy that played particularly well in the boom-and-bust culture of the frontier, and though Twain was now a New York gentleman with a house on Fifth Avenue, nothing made him happier than indulging in some of the old inspired nonsense that had fueled his rise as a Western humorist. By deciding to dress the "twins" at his party in white, and by inventing dialogue for the skit as he went along, he seemed eager to prove that he could still breathe fresh life into an old concept.<br><br>His partner in the skit was a young friend named Witter Bynner&#x2014; a wealthy, Harvard-educated poet and editor. Blessed with neither acting ability nor a great sense of humor, Bynner nevertheless made a good sidekick.

Presents arguments for atheism and godless morality.</p><p>A challenge to believers; an arsenal for skeptics.<i>Losing Faith In Faith</i> records Dan Barker's dramatic journey form devout soul-winner to one of America's most prominent freethinkers. After 19 years of preaching following his "calling" at age 15--including work as a missionary, ordained minister, associate pastor, touring evangelist, Christian songwriter and performer--Dan Barker "lost faith in faith." Today Barker, Public Relations Director of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., frequently represents freethought on the talkshow circuit and at personal appearances around the country. In <i>Losing Faith In Faith</i>, Barker explains why he left the ministry. He also offers a definitive, compelling analysis of why he rejects belief in a god and the claims of religion. He explores the fallacies, inconsistencies, and harm of Christian doctrine and theistic dogma. In its place, he issues an appealing and compassionate invocation of freethought, reason, and humanism. Losing Faith in Faith is both a challenge to believers and an arsenal for skeptics.</p><h2>L&#39;Amant de la Chine Du Nord (French Edition)</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Marguerite Donnadieu, better known as Marguerite Duras (4 April 1914 - 3 March 1996) was a French writer and film director. She was born at Gia-Dinh, near Saigon, French Indochina (now Vietnam), after her parents responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging people to work in the colony. Marguerite&#39;s father fell ill soon after their arrival, and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother, a teacher, remained in Indochina with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after her mother made a bad investment in an isolated property and area of farmland in Cambodia. The difficult life that the family experienced during this period was highly influential on Marguerite&#39;s later work. An affair between the teenaged Marguerite and a Chinese man was to be treated several times (described in quite contrasting ways) in her subseqent memoirs and fiction. She also reported being beaten by both her mother and her older brother during this period. At 17, Marguerite went to France, her parents&#39; native country, where she began studying for a degree in law. This she soon abandoned to concentrate on political sciences, and then law. After completing her studies, she became an active member of the PCF (the French Communist Party). In the late 1930s she worked for the French government office representing the colony of Indochina. During the war, from 1942 to 1944, she worked for the Vichy government in an office that allocated paper to publishers (in the process operating a de facto book censorship system), but she was also a member of the French Resistance. Her husband Robert Anthelme was deported to Bergen-Belsen for his involvement in the Resistance, and barely survived the experience (weighing on his release, according to Marguerite, just 84 lbs). In 1943 she changed her surname for Duras, the name of a village in the Lot-et-Garonne d partement, where her father&#39;s house was located. She is the author of a great many novels, plays, films, interviews and short narratives, including her best-selling, apparently autobiographical work L&#39;Amant (1984), translated into English as The Lover. This text won the Goncourt prize in 1984. The story of her adolescence also appears in three other forms: The Sea Wall, Eden Cinema and The North China Lover. A film version of The Lover, produced by Claude Berri, was released to great success in 1992. Other major works include Moderato Cantabile, also made into a film of the same name, Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein, and her film India Song. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film Hiroshima mon amour, which was directed by Alain Resnais. Duras&#39;s early novels were fairly conventional in form (their &#39;romanticism&#39; was criticised by fellow writer Raymond Queneau); however, with Moderato Cantabile she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the Nouveau roman French literary movement, although did not definitively belong to any group. Her films are also experimental in form, most eschewing synch sound, using voice over to allude to, rather than tell, a story over images whose relation to what is said may be more-or-less tangential. Marguerite&#39;s adult life was somewhat difficult, despite her success as a writer, and she was known for her periods of alcoholism. She died in Paris, aged 81 from throat cancer and is interred in the Cimeti re du Montparnasse. Her tomb is marked simply &#39;MD&#39;.Text: French</p><h2>Just Fly Away</h2><p><b>A </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><b> Bestseller</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;Ever wish that you could just fly away?&#x201d;</i><br><br> When fifteen-year-old Lucy Willows discovers that her father has a child from a brief affair, an eight-year-old boy who lives in her own suburban New Jersey town, she begins to question everything she thinks she knows about her home and her life.

That changes when she discovers that she has a younger brother from a brief affair her father had eight years earlier. Suddenly, Lucy loses interest in school and patience with close friends and family. When school ends, she spends her summer with a new friend, Maxine, and develops a relationship with Maxine's brother, Simon. Meanwhile, Lucy gives her father the silent treatment. Her feelings finally overwhelm her, and she unexpectedly hops on a train to New York City and ends up on a bus to Maine to visit her grandfather, whom she has met only once before. During her visit with him, the protagonist learns a lot about the people around her and about herself. This is clearly a coming-of-age story, in which Lucy must realize that her parents (and grandfather) are human and can make mistakes. Her trip to Maine realistically highlights the dangers of traveling alone as a teenager, and her relationship with Simon shows age-appropriate sexual exploration. While the plot seems like it should be action-packed given its story line, the writing is slow and deliberate, which not all readers will enjoy. Save this novel for your most thoughtful readers.

In a series of exquisite examples that could only have been gathered by a professional philosopher with an extraordinary respect for young minds, Gareth Matthews demonstrates that children have a capacity for puzzlement and mental play that leads them to tackle many of the classic problems of knowledge, value, and existence that have traditionally formed the core of philosophical thought. Matthews&#x2019;s anecdotes reveal children reasoning about these problems in a way that must be taken seriously by anyone who wants to understand how children think.</p><p><i>Philosophy and the Young Child</i> provides a powerful antidote to the widespread tendency to underestimate children&#x2019;s mental ability and patronize their natural curiosity. As Matthews shows, even child psychologists as insightful as Piaget have failed to grasp the subtlety of children&#x2019;s philosophical frame of mind. Only in children&#x2019;s literature does Matthews find any sensitivity to children&#x2019;s natural philosophizing. Old favorites like <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>, the <i>Oz</i> books, and <i>The Bear That Wasn&#x2019;t</i> are full of philosophical puzzlers that amuse and engage children. More important, these stories manage to strip away the mental defensiveness and conventionality that so often prevent adults from appreciating the way children begin to think about the world.</p><p>Gareth Matthews believes that adults have much to gain if they can learn to &#x201c;do philosophy&#x201d; with children, and his book is a rich source of useful suggestions for parents, teachers, students, and anyone else who might like to try.</p></p><p>In a series of exquisite examples that could only have been gathered by a professional philosopher with an extraordinary respect for young minds, Gareth Matthews demonstrates that children have a capacity for puzzlement and mental play that leads them to tackle many of the classic problems that have traditionally formed the core of philosophical thought.Gareth B.

That is one of the great advantages of electronic communications &#x2013; one can simply delete them. And one can do the same to people &#x2013; in their electronic incarnation, of course; at the press of a button, or the equivalent, one can send them off into some vast soup of disassembled digital data, reducing them to floating ones and zeroes, consigned to a Dantean world of echoes, a shadowy underworld of fading impulses.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that, thought Pat, was the fate that Bruce so richly deserved. A few years earlier he had played with her affections, as he had toyed with those of so many other young women, believing that to pay attention to this rather shy young student of art history was to confer on her a benison for which, if she knew anything about the world, she should be profoundly grateful. The expression&nbsp;<i>God&#x2019;s gift to women&nbsp;</i>came into all this &#x2013; somewhere. It was usually uttered sarcastically, as in&nbsp;<i>He</i>&nbsp;<i>thinks he&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s gift to women</i>, but in Bruce&#x2019;s case this was exactly what he did think of himself. In his view he was one of those people who existed to give pleasure to others &#x2013; not through anything he actually did &#x2013; although that, of course, entered into it &#x2013; but simply by being.<br>&nbsp;<br>Auden said that the blessed had no reason to care from what angle they were regarded, having nothing to hide. This was true of Bruce: whether you looked at him from the front, the back, or from either side, the inescapable conclusion was that he was egregiously good-looking. As he pointed out to Catriona, a young woman with whom he once visited Florence, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a statue of my double in this city, you know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She had looked puzzled. &#x201c;Your double, Bruce? Here in Florence?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bruce smirked. &#x201c;Yes, right here. Would you like to see it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She nodded. This was some sort of game, she suspected; but then Bruce was so playful. That was one of the things that attracted her to him &#x2013; his playfulness. That and, of course, the way he made a girl feel special; now that was a very considerable talent. And then there was his hair gel, that strange, clove-scented potion that tickled her nose when she smelled it, and added, in such a curious way, an erotic charge to the most mundane of situations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bruce and Catriona had already visited the Uffizi and had stood for some minutes before Botticelli&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Birth of Venus&nbsp;</i>before Bruce said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Venus, you know. That&#x2019;s her standing in the shell.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Catriona nodded. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s very beautiful, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bruce thought about this for a few moments before he replied. &#x201c;Her neck&#x2019;s a bit long, but, yes, she&#x2019;s beautiful all right.&#x201d; Then, after a short pause, he had observed, &#x201c;Beauty&#x2019;s an interesting thing, isn&#x2019;t it? You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. And that&#x2019;s all there is to it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Catriona looked at Bruce. He returned her gaze with all the confidence of one who knew that he stood on the right side of the divide he had just described.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was in the Uffizi; now they found themselves in the Galleria dell&#x2019;Accademia, looking up at Michelangelo&#x2019;s great masterpiece, the towering statue of David.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;Feast your eyes on that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The contemplation of Michelangelo&#x2019;s David is not easy for everybody, but Catriona looked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lookalike?&#x201d; whispered Bruce.<br>&nbsp;<br>She stared at the line of David&#x2019;s nose and brow: it was undoubtedly Bruce. Her eye followed the sweep of his arms and the musculature of his torso. And she had to admit it:<br>Bruce could have been Michelangelo&#x2019;s young model.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t tell everybody about this,&#x201d; confided Bruce. &#x201c;But I remember when I first saw a photograph of David, I thought: &#x2018;Jeez, that&#x2019;s me.&#x2019; I was about sixteen at the time. In Crieff. I was at Morrison&#x2019;s, you know, and one of the girls in the class stuck a picture of David up in a corridor and wrote underneath it&nbsp;<i>Bruce Anderson</i>. It was so immature, but somehow ...&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pat, of course, had soon detected Bruce&#x2019;s narcissism. But in her state of infatuation &#x2013; for that, she acknowledged, was what it was &#x2013; she had persuaded herself that his self-obsession was a harmless quirk, a hangover from adolescence, a passing phase. After all, there were plenty of young females who were just as fascinated by their appearance, spending hours in front of the mirror. It was more unusual amongst males, perhaps, but what was sauce for the goose should surely be sauce for the gander. If women were to indulge themselves in the contemplation of their own beauty, then why should men not do the same?<br>&nbsp;<br>For a few months, she had circled Bruce, caught in his gravitational field as a moon might be in that of a planet, until at last she managed to extricate herself. When that happened, her father&#x2019;s relief at her escape had been palpable. &#x201c;Men like that are very dangerous,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;The only thing to do is to tear yourself away. Believe me &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve seen it in so many of my patients.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pat&#x2019;s father, Dr Macgregor, a self-deprecating and scholarly man, was a psychiatrist, and was particularly close to his daughter. He and Pat&#x2019;s mother had divorced after she had gone off to restore a walled garden in Perthshire and had never returned. He had done nothing to deserve the desertion, but had been generous in his response. &#x201c;Your mother has found herself elsewhere,&#x201d; he explained to Pat. &#x201c;<i>Il faut cultiver notre</i>&nbsp;<i>jardin</i>, as Candide (I think) pointed out. The important thing is her self-fulfillment &#x2013; that&#x2019;s all that counts.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But there was something else that counted for him, and that was Pat&#x2019;s own happiness. He doted on his daughter and when he realized that she had taken up with Bruce, he had been tipped into depression. At the end of Pat&#x2019;s affair with Bruce &#x2013; an end that he, at least, had realized was inevitable &#x2013; he had tried to explain to her that however low she might feel after the break-up, it was as nothing when compared with the risk she would take in staying with him.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that was why, when she received this invitation to meet Bruce in the Elephant House, Pat said nothing about it to her father. And it was also why she almost deleted it from her e-mail in-box without a reply. Almost, but not quite: she moved the cursor to hover over the delete symbol, hesitated, and then moved it to&nbsp;<i>Reply</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;See you there,&#x201d; she wrote. She added no emoticon &#x2013; for what emoticon is there to express anticipation of the sort she was feeling?</p><h2>Just Imagine Stan Lee Creating the DC Universe Omnibus</h2><p>In 2001, DC Comics announced the unthinkable: Stan Lee, the co-creator of Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and so many more Marvel heroes would reinvent DC&#39;s greatest heroes in a yearlong event.

For millennia horses provided the strength and speed that humans lacked. How we travelled, farmed and fought was dictated by the needs of this extraordinary animal. And then, suddenly, in the 20th century the links were broken and the millions of horses that shared our existence almost vanished, eking out a marginal existence on race-tracks and pony clubs. Farewell to the Horse is an engaging, brilliantly written and moving discussion of what horses once meant to us. Cities, farmland, entire industries were once shaped as much by the needs of horses as humans. The intervention of horses was fundamental in countless historical events. They were sculpted, painted, cherished, admired; they were thrashed, abused and exposed to terrible danger. From the Roman Empire to the Napoleonic Empire every world-conqueror needed to be shown on a horse. Tolstoy once reckoned that he had cumulatively spent some nine years of his life on horseback. Ulrich Raulff&#39;s book, a bestseller in Germany, is a superb monument to the endlessly various creature who has so often shared and shaped our fate.</p><p>Ulrich Raulff is Director of the German Literature Archive in Marbach am Neckar. Previously, he was Literary Editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Managing Editor of the S�ddeutsche Zeitung. He has written books on Marc Bloch and Aby Warburg and won both the the Anna Kr�ger Prize and the Ernst Robert Curtius Prize for Essay Writing. His book on the influence of the German poet Stefan George was awarded the 2010 Leipzig Book Fair Prize.A beautiful and thoughtful exploration of the role of the horse in creating our world... lyrical and creative...I very much enjoyed it.

(biography &amp; autobiography).</p><p>Coming soon...<br><br>Coming soon...Brain on Fire CHAPTER 1<p></p> BEDBUG BLUES<p></p> <br>Maybe it all began with a bug bite, from a bedbug that didn&#x2019;t exist.<br> <br>One morning, I&#x2019;d woken up to find two red dots on the main purplish-blue vein running down my left arm. It was early 2009, and New York City was awash in bedbug scares: they infested offices, clothing stores, movie theaters, and park benches. Though I wasn&#x2019;t naturally a worrier, my dreams had been occupied for two nights straight by finger-long bedbugs. It was a reasonable concern, though after carefully scouring the apartment, I couldn&#x2019;t find a single bug or any evidence of their presence. Except those two bites. I even called in an exterminator to check out my apartment, an overworked Hispanic man who combed the whole place, lifting up my sofa bed and shining a flashlight into places I had never before thought to clean. He proclaimed my studio bug free. That seemed unlikely, so I asked for a follow-up appointment for him to spray. To his credit, he urged me to wait before shelling out an astronomical sum to do battle against what he seemed to think was an imaginary infestation. But I pressed him to do it, convinced that my apartment, my bed, my body had been overrun by bugs. He agreed to return and exterminate.<br> <br>Concerned as I was, I tried to conceal my growing unease from my coworkers. Understandably, no one wanted to be associated with a person with a bedbug problem. So at work the following day, I walked as nonchalantly as possible through the newsroom of the New York Post to my cubicle. I was careful to conceal my bites and tried to appear casual, normal. Not that &#x201c;normal&#x201d; means a lot at the Post.<br> <br>Though it&#x2019;s notoriously obsessed with what&#x2019;s new, the Post is nearly as old as the nation itself. Established by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, it is the longest continually run newspaper in the country. In its first century alone, the paper crusaded for the abolition movement and helped promote the creation of Central Park. Today the newsroom itself is cavernous yet airless, filled with rows of open cubicles and a glut of filing cabinets packed with decades of unused, forgotten documents. The walls are freckled with clocks that don&#x2019;t run, dead flowers hung upside down to dry, a picture of a monkey riding a border collie, and a big foam Six Flags finger, all memorabilia from reporters&#x2019; assignments. The PCs are ancient, the copy machines the size of small ponies. A small utility closet that once served as a smoking room now holds supplies, and is marked by a weathered sign warning that the smoking room no longer exists, as if someone might accidentally wander in for a cigarette among the monitors and video equipment. This has been my eccentric little world for the past seven years, since I started here as a seventeen-year-old intern.<br> <br>Especially around deadline, the room buzzes with activity&#x2014;keyboards clacking, editors yelling, reporters cackling&#x2014;the perfect stereotype of a tabloid newsroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the fucking picture to go with this caption?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How is it that he didn&#x2019;t know she was a prostitute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What color were the socks of the guy who jumped off the bridge?&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like a bar without alcohol, filled with adrenaline-soaked news junkies. The cast of characters here is unique to the Post: the brightest headline writers in the business, the hardened newshounds hunting after exclusives, and type-A workaholics who possess the chameleon ability to either befriend or antagonize almost anyone. Still, on most days, the newsroom is subdued, as everyone silently combs through court documents, interviews sources, or reads newspapers. Often, like today, the newsroom is as quiet as a morgue.<br> <br>Heading toward my desk to start the day, I wove through the rows of cubicles marked by green Manhattan street signs: Liberty Street, Nassau Street, Pine Street, and William Street, throwbacks to a time when the Post was actually flanked by those downtown streets in its previous home at the South Street Seaport. My desk is at Pine Street. Amid the silence, I slid into my seat beside Angela, my closest friend at the paper, and gave her a tense smile. Trying not to let my question echo too loudly across the noiseless room, I asked, &#x201c;You know anything about bedbug bites?&#x201d;<br> <br>I often joked that if I ever had a daughter, I&#x2019;d want her to be like Angela. In many ways, she is my newsroom hero. When I first met her, three years before, she was a soft-spoken, shy young woman from Queens, only a few years older than me. She had arrived at the Post from a small weekly paper and since then had matured under the pressure of a big-city tabloid into one of the Post&#x2019;s most talented reporters, churning out reams of our best stories. Most late Friday nights, you&#x2019;d find Angela writing four stories on split screens simultaneously. I couldn&#x2019;t help but look up to her. Now I really needed her advice.<br> <br>Hearing that dreaded word, bedbugs, Angela scooted her chair away from mine. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you have them,&#x201d; she said with an impish smile. I started to show her my arm, but before I could get into my tale of woe, my phone rang.<br> <br>&#x201c;You ready?&#x201d; It was the new Sunday editor, Steve. He was just barely in his midthirties, yet he had already been named head editor of the Sunday paper, the section I worked for, and despite his friendliness, he intimidated me. Every Tuesday, each reporter had a pitch meeting to showcase some of his or her ideas for that Sunday&#x2019;s paper. At the sound of his voice, I realized with panic that I was completely unprepared for this week&#x2019;s meeting. Usually I had at least three coherent ideas to pitch; they weren&#x2019;t always great, but I always had something. Now I had nothing, not even enough to bluff my way through the next five minutes. How had I let that happen? This meeting was impossible to forget, a weekly ritual that we all fastidiously prepared for, even during days off.<br> <br>Bedbugs forgotten, I widened my eyes at Angela as I stood back up, gamely hoping it all would work out once I got to Steve&#x2019;s office.<br> <br>Nervously, I walked back down &#x201c;Pine Street&#x201d; and into Steve&#x2019;s office. I sat down next to Paul, the Sunday news editor and close friend who had mentored me since I was a sophomore in college, giving him a nod but avoiding direct eye contact. I readjusted my scratched-up wide-framed Annie Hall glasses, which a publicist friend once described as my own form of birth control because &#x201c;no one will sleep with you with those on.&#x201d;<br> <br>We sat there in silence for a moment, as I tried to let myself be comforted by Paul&#x2019;s familiar, larger-than-life presence. With his shock of prematurely white hair and his propensity to toss the word fuck around like a preposition, he is the essence of a throwback newsman and a brilliant editor.<br> <br>He had given me a shot as a reporter during the summer of my sophomore year of college after a family friend introduced us. After a few years in which I worked as a runner, covering breaking news and feeding information to another reporter to write the piece, Paul offered me my first big assignment: an article on the debauchery at a New York University fraternity house. When I returned with a story and pictures of me playing beer pong, he was impressed with my chutzpah; even though the expos� never ran, he assigned me more stories until I had been hired on full time in 2008. Now, as I sat in Steve&#x2019;s office wholly unprepared, I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like a work in progress, not worthy of Paul&#x2019;s faith and respect.<br> <br>The silence deepened until I looked up. Steve and Paul were staring at me expectantly, so I just started talking, hoping something would come. &#x201c;I saw this story on a blog&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; I said, desperately plucking up wisps of half-formed ideas.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s really just not good enough,&#x201d; Steve interrupted. &#x201c;You need to be bringing in better stuff than this. Okay? Please don&#x2019;t come in with nothing again.&#x201d; Paul nodded, his face blazing red. For the first time since I&#x2019;d started working on my high school newspaper, journalism disagreed with me. I left the meeting furious at myself and bewildered by my own ineptitude.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Angela asked as I returned to my desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you know, I&#x2019;m just bad at my job. No big deal,&#x201d; I joked grimly.<br> <br>She laughed, revealing a few charmingly crooked incisor teeth. &#x201c;Oh, come on, Susannah. What happened? Don&#x2019;t take it seriously. You&#x2019;re a pro.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Ang,&#x201d; I said, sipping my lukewarm coffee. &#x201c;Things just aren&#x2019;t going my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>I brooded over the day&#x2019;s disasters that evening as I walked west from the News Corp. building on Sixth Avenue, through the tourist clusterfuck that is Times Square, toward my apartment in Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen. As if purposely living the clich� of a New York writer, I rented a cramped one-room studio, where I slept on a pullout sofa. The apartment, eerily quiet, overlooked the courtyard of several tenements, and I often awoke not to police sirens and grumbling garbage trucks but to the sound of a neighbor playing the accordion on his balcony.<br> <br>Still obsessed with my bites, despite the exterminator&#x2019;s assurance that I had nothing to worry about, I prepared for him to spray the place and spent that night discarding things that could be harboring bedbugs. Into the garbage went my beloved Post clips, hundreds of articles reminding me of how bizarre my job is: the victims and suspects, dangerous slums, prisons and hospitals, twelve-hour shifts spent shivering inside photographers&#x2019; cars waiting to photograph&#x2014;or &#x201c;pop&#x201d;&#x2014;celebrities. I had always loved every minute of it. So why was I suddenly so terrible at it?<br> <br>As I shoved these treasures into the trash bags, I paused on a few headlines, among them the biggest story of my career to date: the time I managed to land an exclusive jailhouse interview with child kidnapper Michael Devlin. The national media were hot on the story, and I was only a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, yet Devlin spoke to me twice. But the story didn&#x2019;t end there. His lawyers went nuts after the article ran, launching a smear campaign against the Post and calling for a judicial gag order, while the local and national media began debating my methods on live TV and questioning the ethics of jailhouse interviews and tabloids in general. Paul fielded several tearful phone calls from me during that time, which bound us together, and in the end, both the paper and my editors stood by me. Though the experience had rattled me, it also whetted my appetite, and from then on, I became the resident &#x201c;jailhouser.&#x201d; Devlin was eventually sentenced to three consecutive lifetimes in prison.<br> <br>Then there was the butt implant story, &#x201c;Rear and Present Danger,&#x201d; a headline that still makes me laugh. I had to go undercover as a stripper looking for cheap butt enhancements from a woman who was illegally dispensing them out of a midtown hotel room. As I stood there with my pants around my ankles, I tried not to be insulted when she announced that she would need &#x201c;a thousand dollars per cheek,&#x201d; twice the amount she charged the woman who had come forward to the Post.<br> <br>Journalism was thrilling; I had always loved living a reality that was more fabulist than fiction, though little did I know that my life was about to become so bizarre as to be worthy of coverage in my own beloved tabloid.<br> <br>Even though the memory made me smile, I added this clip to the growing trash pile&#x2014;&#x201c;where it belongs,&#x201d; I scoffed, despite the fact that those crazy stories had meant the world to me. Though it felt necessary at the moment, this callous throwing away of years&#x2019; worth of work was completely out of character for me. I was a nostalgic pack rat, who held on to poems that I had written in fourth grade and twenty-some-odd diaries that dated back to junior high. Though there didn&#x2019;t seem to be much of a connection among my bedbug scare, my forgetfulness at work, and my sudden instinct to purge my files, what I didn&#x2019;t know then is that bug obsession can be a sign of psychosis. It&#x2019;s a little-known problem, since those suffering from parasitosis, or Ekbom syndrome, as it&#x2019;s called, are most likely to consult exterminators or dermatologists for their imaginary infestations instead of mental health professionals, and as a result they frequently go undiagnosed. My problem, it turns out, was far vaster than an itchy forearm and a forgotten meeting.<br> <br>After hours of packing everything away to ensure a bedbug-free zone, I still didn&#x2019;t feel any better. As I knelt by the black garbage bags, I was hit with a terrible ache in the pit of my stomach&#x2014;that kind of free-floating dread that accompanies heartbreak or death. When I got to my feet, a sharp pain lanced my mind, like a white-hot flash of a migraine, though I had never suffered from one before. As I stumbled to the bathroom, my legs and body just wouldn&#x2019;t react, and I felt as if I were slogging through quicksand. I must be getting the flu, I thought.<br> <br><br> <br>This might not have been the flu, though, the same way there may have been no bedbugs. But there likely was a pathogen of some sort that had invaded my body, a little germ that set everything in motion. Maybe it came from that businessman who had sneezed on me in the subway a few days before, releasing millions of virus particles onto the rest of us in that subway car? Or maybe it was in something I ate or something that slipped inside me through a tiny wound on my skin, maybe through one of those mysterious bug bites?<br> <br>There my mind goes again.<br> <br>The doctors don&#x2019;t actually know how it began for me. What&#x2019;s clear is that if that man had sneezed on you, you&#x2019;d most likely just get a cold. For me, it flipped my universe upside down and very nearly sent me to an asylum for life.</p><h2>What is Spiritism</h2><p>A work that is still up-to-date, What is Spiritism? is useful for adherents of the Spiritist Doctrine as well as for those who want to understand the nature of Spiritism and its fundamental points. Kardec&#x2019;s logic and common sense are obvious in this book as he confounds Spiritism&#x2019;s detractors while answering the questions of those who believe in and aspire to a superior life. The book is divided into three chapters. The first is composed of dialogues between Kardec and a critic, a skeptic and a priest, providing answers to those who do not understand the basic principles of Spiritism. It also presents appropriate refutations to its opponents. The second chapter presents practical and experimental aspects of the science and is a kind of summary of The Mediums&#x2019; Book. The third chapter is a short synthesis of The Spirits&#x2019; Book, with solutions to psychological, moral and philosophical problems according to the Spiritist Doctrine. In addition, the book is prefaced with an abridged version of Henri Sausse&#x2019;s biography of Allan Kardec.</p><p></p><h2>Newman&#39;s Vision of Faith: A Theology for Times of General Apostasy</h2><p>A study of Cardinal Newman&#39;s ideas on Christianity by a leading Catholic theologian, himself a convert to Catholicism, as was Newman. &#34;Newman&#39;s was a clear and profound realization of what is fundamental and permanent in Christianity.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Julia and the Bazooka (Peter Owen Modern Classic)</h2><p>Anna Kavan now stands alongside Virginia Woolf as one of Britain's great 20th-century modernists.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this posthumous collection of Kavan's short stories, some of&nbsp;the author's&nbsp;most compelling writing is revealed,&nbsp;inspired in great part by&nbsp;her personal experiences&#x2014;especially her nearly lifelong addiction to heroin.

But you&#x2019;d have to be a pretty cynical reader not to fall for Don Tillman, a handsome genetics professor who has crafted a pathologically micromanaged life for himself but can&#x2019;t seem to score a second date. After launching his Wife Project, which includes a hilarious questionnaire intended to weed out imperfect candidates--smokers, makeup wearers, vegans (&#x201c;incredibly annoying&#x201d;)--Don meets Rosie, a stunning, maddeningly disorganized bartender/student who&#x2019;s looking for her biological father. The reader knows just where the story is headed: Rosie&#x2019;s so wrong for Don, she&#x2019;s perfect. That&#x2019;s not giving anything away. Half the fun of the book is watching pent-up, Asperger&#x2019;s-afflicted Don break free, thanks to Rosie, from his precisely controlled, annoyingly sensible, and largely humorless lifestyle. By the final third, you&#x2019;re cheering for Don to shatter all his rules.

Lewis (www.rclewisbooks.com and @RC_Lewis) teaches math to teenagers-sometimes in sign language, sometimes not-so whether she&#39;s a science geek or a bookworm depends on when you look. That may explain why her characters don&#39;t like to be pigeonholed. Coincidentally, R.C. enjoys reading about quantum physics and the identity issues of photons."Snow White" gets an upgrade in this clever, surprisingly gritty science-fiction version. Essie has spent eight years hiding in the hardscrabble mining settlements of Thanda, cage fighting for cash and "stitching" machine code, especially for her seven autonomous drones. When Dane, the charming offworlder she rescues from a shuttle crash, discovers that she is the long-lost Princess Snow, he can't leave behind such a valuable pawn in the ongoing interplanetary war. But what if Essie refuses to go home? Elements of the classic fairy tale are skillfully woven into this update, with a particularly delightful nod to the Disney dwarves. But Essie is no passive, pretty princess; she is tough, cynical, paranoid and prone to violent rages-rough edges that gradually make sense as the horrific truths about her childhood are revealed. Dane, in contrast, is the perfect prince: strong, gentle, devoted and (irritatingly) slightly better than Essie at everything. Sweet romance and graphic violence, earthy humor and chilling abuse, space-opera settings and vintage derring-do-they all intertwine with unexpected panache. If the wicked king and the downright monstrous stepmother are cartoonishly evil, their villainous schemes implausibly over-the-top and the climactic revolt against their tyranny ludicrously simple well, the source tale is hardly free of plot holes, either, and who cares when it's so entertaining? A fine addition to the ever popular subgenre of fairy-tale adaptations.

Inside, she finds the mysterious Dane, a young man from the planet Garam. They clash immediately, he from the upper echelons and she barely scraping by, but their romance builds gradually and irresistibly. Together, they seek a treasure that could change the galaxy and both their lives. They travel to other planets and meet revolutionaries while narrowly avoiding immigration control, which could imprison both of them, as well as hired killers with eyes out for anyone who could disrupt the status quo in the capital city of Windsong. Readers are thrown right into the action-the novel opens with a cage fight between protagonist Essie and a miner-but progress from there is slow. There's a definite learning curve to the invented vocabulary, which may deter causal readers. It's a gripping story with lots of moving parts and will likely appeal to fans of genre fiction. Stacey Comfort Booklist"<br><br>Even by the rough-and-tumble standards of the frozen planet Thanda, Essie is unusual-she likes to cage-fight angry men just back from working in the mines, and when Essie isn't fighting, she's a mechanic, fixing ships and tinkering with drones. After a stranger named Dane crashes on Thanda, Essie tries to help him, but ends up getting kidnapped. She's taken to Dane's planet, Candara, where his people plan to trade her to the king in exchange for the release of Candaran prisoners, one of whom is Dane's father. Essie is a valuable find-she's actually a young princess who escaped the clutches of the stepmother who tried to kill her when she was nine. In this interplanetary retelling of Snow White, debut author Lewis reveals a talent for worldbuilding and creating complex, memorable characters. As Essie owns up to her past and takes control of her fate, SF and fairytale fans alike will enjoy watching her beat the odds and find romance in the process. Ages 14 up. PW"<br><br>Gr 7 Up Essie is the only female living in mining settlement Forty-Two and earns her keep by "stitching" or repairing junk-tech for the local miners. She is an unwelcome presence, despite her much-needed expertise, and leads a precarious and solitary existence. When a shuttle crashes, leaving a stranger named Dane without a functional ship, Essie begrudgingly agrees to help him. It turns out that Dane is on a search for Princess Snow, the royal heir who went missing eight years ago. Once he realizes that Essie is indeed the princess, he kidnaps her, intending to use her as a bargaining chip in a prisoner swap. Forced to divulge secrets that she has long guarded, Essie convinces Dane that she is no friend of the court and the two join forces. This is a superb sci-fi retelling of "Snow White." Lewis does a marvelous job of slowly revealing the backstory of Essie's royal childhood, her incestuous relationship with the king, and the mystery surrounding her real mother. Inventive nods to the original fairy tale, such as the seven droids Essie built and the death scene of the evil queen, are expertly done. This has strong appeal for sci-fi and fantasy lovers and fans of Marissa Meyer's "Lunar Chronicles" (Feiwel &amp; Friends). Amy Nolan, St. Joseph Public Library, St. Joseph, MI SLJ"<br><br>4Q 4P J S Essie would be very happy to continue her bare but hidden existence troubleshooting tech glitches with her seven drones on the frozen mining planet of Thanda. Earning extra cash with the occasional cage fight and improving the efficiency and safety of the dangerous mine operation keep her mind off the life she fled eight years ago-a life of royalty on Windsong. Her equilibrium up-ends when Essie rescues crash-landed Dane, a rebel fighter from Candara, Windsong's enemy twin-planet. Dane is seeking leverage to gain the release of his imprisoned father and when he discovers Essie's identity, he is pretty sure he has found it. His plot to kidnap her quickly becomes more complicated when their journey is waylaid and Essie's tech skills make her valuable to the ruthless government on the desert planet of Garam. Essie discovers that the war raged by her father, Mathias, king of Windsong, and his murderous wife, Olivia, has kept this corner of the universe in upheaval since her flight, and her escape might be considered the cause. Beyond the basic set up, Lewis's retelling of the classic tale re-imagines Snow White as a self-determined, whip-smart young woman. Lewis has found the sweet spot of building a plot with reasonable intrigue and complication without getting bogged down in detail. Her knowledge of math and science-both real and futuristic conjecture-is liberally sprinkled throughout the story. Essie, aka Princess Snow, has built up walls of personal self-preservation eight years thick and Lewis realistically depicts her readjustment to a world that offers and expects empathy. This includes the romantic development between Essie and Dane, which Lewis appropriately puts on a slow boil on the back burner. Two of Essie's drones, Dimwit and Cusser, are characters Lewis might have done well to develop further, along with the world building. Overall, Stitching Snow is a satisfying read for those who appreciate strong female protagonists embedded in plots of intrigue.-Lauri J. Vaughan. Stitching Snow is an interesting spin on the story of Snow White, placing the fairy tale in a technologically advanced setting. The romantic part of the novel is somewhat predictable, though not overdone; the narrative is not buried under Essie's changing feelings about Dane. As a whole, Stitching Snow is an engaging read, combining a dystopian future world with a familiar story set in the past. 4Q, 4P.-Allison Wang, Teen Reviewer. VOYA"<br><br>For eight years, the frozen tundras of the planet Thanda have been Essie's home, and the seventeen-year-old girl is mostly content to tinker with her seven drones and serve as impromptu mechanic for the local mines. Her desire to help trumps her usual self-preservation instincts when a mysterious boy, Dane, crashes his spaceship near her home, and soon she finds herself kidnapped and brought to Candara, Dane's home planet. There Essie admits to being Princess Snow, whom everyone thought was kidnapped years ago, but who really ran away from King Matthias, her father and rapist, and Queen Olivia, her stepmother and attempted murderer. Now Dane and his planet's ruling council plan to use Essie to end Matthias' reign of terror-whether she's a willing participant or not. Several of the Snow White motifs are satisfyingly turned on their head here, and fans of Marissa Meyer's The Lunar Chronicles (Cinder, BCCB 2/12, etc.) will feel right at home with the combination of sci-fi and fairy tale elements. The pacing is lightning quick, with our planet-hopping heroes moving from one obstacle to the next, and while that may at first cause readers a bit of whiplash, it also allows the story to wrap up in one installment. Lewis doesn't sacrifice world-building for plot, either, deftly incorporating details about both the interplanetary conflicts and Essie's history as the action moves swiftly along. Essie's got the wit and strength to compete with any YA heroine, but it's her conflicted feelings toward her father and her willingness to finally save herself that make her memorable. This will certainly ease the wait for readers anxious for Meyer's next installment. KQG BCCB"<br><br>Essie has lived much of her life on the desolate planet of Thanda. She spends her time stitching up her trusted androids and fighting the miners who control the cold, barren terrain. Essie has many secrets; Dane, a young stranger, wants Essie's secrets. With Dane's help, Essie decides that she must take control of her life, and not be afraid of her true identity. Lewis's novel is an interesting take on the Snow White fairytale. Those familiar with the tale will instantly recognize the parallels; however, Lewis has truly made this story her own. The science fiction elements add an extra layer. Some elements of the world building are glossed over, and the reader is left with more questions than answers. Those students who gravitate towards science fiction/fantasy will not be disappointed.

This volume contains writing from every phase of Judy Grahn's career, including poems from all of her major poetry collections, such as "The Common Woman," "A Woman is Talking to Death," and the previously unpublished "Mental"; a number of her groundbreaking essays ("Writing from a House of Women" and the newly revised "Ground Zero: The Rise of Lesbian Feminism," among others); as well as selected fiction and the full-length play <em>The Queen of Swords</em>.

She grew up in a working-class home in New Mexico. Seeking options not available in her small-town community of origin, she broke away and joined the Air Force. She was given a "blue discharge" (named for the blue paper on which these letters were printed) from the Air Force because she was a lesbian. This experience galvanized Grahn into public ownership of her lesbianism, into the writing of poetry, into lesbian activism, and into the project of publishing lesbian literature. She co-founded the Women's Press Collective in Oakland, California, in 1969; using a barrel mimeograph machine, the WPC published the work of Grahn and other lesbians, including Pat Parker, Willyce Kim, and more. The WPC edition of Grahn's book <em>Edward the Dyke and Other Poems</em> appeared in 1971. Other poetry collections include <em>The Common Woman</em> (1969), <em>A Woman Is Talking to Death</em> (1974), <em>The Queen of Swords</em> (1987), and <em>Love Belongs to Those Who Do the Feeling</em> (2009). Aunt Lute published a collection of Grahn's work in 2009, THE JUDY GRAHN READER. In addition to her poetry, Grahn has written extensively of what it means to be a lesbian and a lesbian writer in books including <em>Another Mother Tongue: Gay Words, Gay Worlds </em>(1984), <em>Really Reading Gertrude Stein</em> (1989), and <em>Blood, Bread and Roses: How Menstruation Created the World</em> (1993).</p><h2>The Weight of All Things</h2><p>The last time Nicols saw his mother, she was mortally wounded by gunfire that erupted in a crowded plaza.

She then moved to the United States and received an undergraduate from Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman University). She published her first novel, <i>A Place Where the Sea Remembers</i>, when she was 52. It won the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Award, the Minnesota Book Award, and was a finalist for the <i>Los Angles Times</i> First Fiction Award.Set in El Salvador during the civil war of the 1980s, Ben!tez's third novel (after A Place Where the Sea Remembers and Bitter Grounds) seamlessly blends fact with imagination, evoking the trauma of war more vividly than any newspaper account. Nine-year-old Nicol s de la Virgen Veras lives with his grandfather Tata in Chalatenango, El Salvador, but on March 30, 1980, his mother, Lety, who works in San Salvador for Don Enrique, brings him to the city to witness the burial of a martyred saint, Archbishop Romero. In a bloodbath based on a real-life event, 35 people in the crowd of 80,000 are killed and 450 wounded by soldiers' fire. Lety dies protecting Nicol s. When her body is taken away, Nicol s cannot believe she is dead and tries first to find the hospital for the wounded, then to get home to find Don Enrique's address. As he journeys through the bleak Salvadoran landscape, Nicol s is caught in the violent clashes between the National Army and guerrilla rebels. Held at different times by each faction, Nicol s must rely on his wits and faith in the Virgin Mary if he is to survive. Ben!tez's novel is both political and spiritual, beautifully illuminating the effects of war on the innocent. Like the Sumpul River of Nicol s's hometown, which alternately rages and soothes, Ben!tez's style is both quiet and intense. Her achievement here is considerable; in this brief narrative, she gives voice to the silenced. Those who seek a deeper understanding of Latin American conflict and who appreciate Ben!tez's moral stance will find the novel especially gratifying. 6-city author tour. (Feb.)

Acquitted of murdering her husband, she has inherited all his money, and can afford to dress in the height of 1940s style. Unfortunately, her fashionable clothing and coiffure go unseen, and much of her money unspent, as the Widow Gregson remains essentially a prisoner, trapped in her elegant New York apartment with occasional, furtive forays to her Connecticut estate. A jury may have found her innocent, but Mrs. Gregson remains a murderer in the eyes of the public, and of the tabloid journalists who hound her every step. Worse, she has recently begun receiving increasingly menacing letters &#x2013; letters written, she is certain, by the person who killed her husband. Taking the matter to the police would only heighten her notoriety, so she calls on Henry Gamadge, the gentleman-sleuth known both for his discretion and for his ability to solve problems that baffle the police.

As Editor Mark Howe explains, it is not merely a work of legal history but also a profound philosophical work that argued on behalf of a pragmatic Anglo-American theory of law (that focussed on sanctioning an individual for the injury done to common good) against a romantic Kantian and Hegelian outlook (that introduced subjective considerations of the morality and virtue of the accused and victim). 338 pages with index.</p><p>59th printingOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (1841-1935) served as chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Rabinovitz argues that avant-garde cinema, open to women because of its marginal status in the art world, included women as filmmakers, organizers, and critics.<br> <br> Focusing on Maya Deren, Shirley Clarke, and Joyce Wieland, Rabinovitz illustrates how women used bold physical images to enhance their work and how each provided entr�e to her subversive art while remaining culturally acceptable. She combines archival materials with her own interviews to show how the women's labor and films, even their identities as women filmmakers, were produced, disseminated, and understood. With a new preface and an updated bibliography, Points of Resistance simultaneously demonstrates the avant-garde's importance as an organizational network for women filmmakers and the processes by which women remained marginal figures within that network.<br></p><p><b>Lauren Rabinovitz</b> is an associate professor in the American Studies Program and communication studies department at the University of Iowa, and the author of <i>For The Love of Pleasure.</i><br>&#34;Recent feminist film theory has often called for a new kind of nonpatriarchal, resistant filmmaking practice.

Supporting their conclusions with statistics on education, earnings, and housing, they argue that the perception of serious racial divisions in this country is outdated -- and dangerous.</p><p>Written by a pair of social scientists--Stephan Thernstrom is a professor of history at Harvard; his wife, Abigail, is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute--<i>America in Black and White</i> is a comprehensive look at how much life has changed (and remained the same) for black Americans. The authors conclude that, while much remains to be done, life has gotten measurably better for blacks since the civil rights movement. For example, only a quarter of black families live below the poverty line, as compared with more than three-quarters of black families in 1940; similarly, where 60 percent of working black women were domestics in 1940, today a majority are white-collar workers. In what will likely prove to be the most controversial of their conclusions, the authors argue that, while many problems remain, traditional civil rights remedies, such as affirmative action and racial preferences, will not solve those problems.<b>Stephan Thernstrom,</b> the Winthrop Professor of History at Harvard University, is the editor of <i>The Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups</i> and the author of several other books.</p><h2>Seaweed: A collection of simple and delicious recipes from an ocean of food</h2><p>There is more to seaweed than as a wrapper for sushi &#x2013; it is going mainstream, gathering many high profile fans, even Jamie Oliver has credited adding seaweed to his diet as one reason for his weight loss.

The angels, who look like trolls with their big noses and feet, bring mother animals and their offspring onstage, using ropes and brute strength in the case of the donkey. Two tap-dancing pigs in top hats add a bit of slapstick to the production, which is then contradicted by the appearance of a perfectly normal, serenely sleeping baby Jesus, lovingly gazed at by the eccentric creatures. Rendered in muted watercolors, the depictions of the animals are endearing but the angels are rather unsettling and the overall package is not always in keeping with the tone of the original.-E.

In 1973 Broughton Coburn lived and taught&nbsp;&nbsp;school in a subsistence farming village on the edge&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nepal's Himalayan mountains. It was there that&nbsp;&nbsp;he met and developed a unique friendship with a&nbsp;&nbsp;septuagenarian native widow named Vishnu Maya&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurung, fondly known to her relatives and locals as Aama&nbsp;&nbsp;(mother). When Coburn moved into the hay loft&nbsp;&nbsp;above her water buffalo shed, Aama became his&nbsp;&nbsp;landlady, but she also treated him like the son she never&nbsp;&nbsp;had. Having lost his own mother shortly before he&nbsp;&nbsp;met Aama, Coburn took an instant liking to the&nbsp;&nbsp;sprightly Nepalese woman. Already a success in two&nbsp;&nbsp;previous small press editions, <i>Nepali&nbsp;&nbsp;Aama</i> is Coburn's enchanting account of his&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences living, working, and traveling with Aama,&nbsp;&nbsp;illustrated with his own photos and Aama's candid,&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes salty, often hilarious observations on&nbsp;&nbsp;everyday life in the rural third world. By&nbsp;&nbsp;combining Aama's deep-rooted wisdom with his striking&nbsp;&nbsp;black-and-white photographs, Coburn places the reader&nbsp;&nbsp;in a setting that few have ever experienced. He&nbsp;&nbsp;also offers rare insight into a culture alive with&nbsp;&nbsp;humor, folklore, and&nbsp;&nbsp;religion.<br><br>"Aama and her people were poor and uneducated, but&nbsp;&nbsp;they seemed to possess an uncanny strength&nbsp;&nbsp;grounded in tradition, family, community, and&nbsp;&nbsp;self-sufficiency," he writes.

National ad/promo.</p><p>An abundance of little-known details and disclosures graces Carlos Baker's last work of literary criticism, bringing to life not only Ralph Waldo Emerson the man, but also a whole cultural milieu known for its brilliance, artistic flowering, and progressive thinking. The portrait of Emerson emerges as if through a mosaic. We see him primarily through the eyes of others--their letters and journal entries--reminding readers that Emerson did not exist in a vacuum. The eccentrics of the title include such Concord transcendentalists as Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Bronson Alcott, as well as many prominent intellectuals of the day (Margaret Fuller, Walt Whitman, and the abolitionist John Brown). Many will find the details of this venerable American life familiar--the impoverished boyhood and physical fragility, the breaking from orthodoxy as a clergyman, and the tragic loss of a spouse--but most readers will enjoy the complex picture of the man pieced together through his friendships. Emerson's prickly but persevering relationship with Margaret Fuller is described in both of their letters and journals, rounding out an often one-sided account. Fuller was a brilliant, self-assured, thoroughly modern woman--a trait that would continue to repel and baffle Emerson throughout the long life of their friendship; for that, he seemed never quite able to forgive her. <p>Still, Emerson redeemed himself with his revolutionary break from European culture and the calcified thoughts of those who preceded him. His was a unique and inimitable independence that would come to characterize American intellectualism; however, the stubborn optimism that would taint Emersonian philosophy still lingers. </p><p>Famed literary critic Carlos Baker, who died in 1987, has left a substantial yet thoroughly engaging antidote to our often craven, corrupt, corporate-driven world. <i>Emerson Among the Eccentrics</i> recreates both the voices and visions of one of America's most distinguished and accomplished cultural periods.</p>Carlos Baker was a distinguished scholar and literary critic at Princeton University for more than forty years.</p><h2>Celtic Art: From Its Beginnings to the Book of Kells</h2><p><p><strong>Since it was first published, <em>Celtic Art</em> has established itself as the standard introduction to a vast field of European artistic endeavor.</strong></p> The authors have continued to keep abreast of discoveries and new interpretations of old material from Britain to Bulgaria, and the fruits of their research and travel are incorporated in this revised edition. Ranging from the Black Sea to the Baltic and from Anatolia to County Armagh, the Megaws investigate the antecedents of Celtic art, the styles and motifs employed, the relationship of the Celts and their art to the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, and the magnificent maturity of Celtic art in Britain and Ireland. They include major discoveries that have been made as the result of highway and rail construction and the results of detailed surveys of known sites, such as the recovery of the remarkable stone sculpture from the Glauberg northwest of Frankfurt.

On her father's death six years later, she inherited the Swedish throne. She was tutored by Descartes, yet could swear like the roughest soldier. She was painted a lesbian, a prostitute, a hermaphrodite, and an atheist; in that tumultuous age, it is hard to determine which was the most damning label. She was learned but restless, progressive yet self-indulgent; her leadership was erratic, her character unpredictable. Sweden was too narrow for her ambition. No sooner had she enjoyed the lavish celebrations of her officialcoronation at twenty-three than she abdicated, converting to Catholicism (an act of almost foolhardy independence and political challenge) and leaving her cold homeland behind for an extravagant new life in Rome. Christina, Queen of Sweden, longed fatally for adventure.</p><p>Freed from her crown, Christina cut a breath-taking path across Europe: spending madly, searching for a more prestigious throne to scale, stirring trouble wherever she went. Supported and encouraged in turn by the pope, the king of Spain, and France's powerful Cardinal Mazarin, Christina settled at the luxurious Palazzo Farnese, where she established a lavish salon for Rome's artists and intellectuals. More than once the cross-dressing queen was forced to leave town until a scandal died down. She loved to buckle on a sword and swagger like the men whose company she adored, but the greatest mystery in her life was the true nature of her elusive sexuality, which biographer Veronica Buckley explores with sensitivity and rigor. For a time it seemed there was nothing this extraordinary woman might fear attempting, until a bloody tragedy of her own making foreshadowed her downfall.</p><p>Pairing painstaking research with a sparkling narrative voice and unerring sense of the age, Veronica Buckley reclaims a protean life that had been preserved mostly as myth. Christina was a child of her time, and her time was one of great change: Europe stood at a crossroads where religion and science, antiquity and modernity, peace and war all met. Christina took what she wanted from each to create the life she most desired, and she dazzled all who met her.</p></p><p><p>Veronica Buckley was born in New Zealand. She studied in London and Oxford, where she did her postgraduate work on Christina Alexandra. She now lives in Paris with her husband, writer Philipp Blom. This is her first book.</p>Christina abdicated the throne of Lutheran Sweden in 1654, at age 28, presumably in order to convert to Catholicism. Buckley presents a wide-ranging, entertaining exploration of the dynamics of the queen's decision and unusual life. The author, in her debut, convincingly demonstrates that it wasn't religion that drew Christina to Rome, but a love of art and the ancients. Nor did a true love of philosophy encourage her fateful invitation to Descartes to come to Stockholm, but a restless, clever mind and a belief in her own great potential. Nor, says Buckley, did homosexuality lead her to decline marriage but a larger sexual ambivalence. Attracted to both men and women, yet disgusted by the idea of sex, Christina was most comfortable in masculine garb, critical of women and bitterly aware of the limitations society placed on women. Buckley weaves these threads together in a lively portrait, laying out the background to her story in fluid prose, from political and military aspects of the Thirty Years' War to machinations of the papal and French courts and the fragile state of the monarchy in Sweden. Against this background, Christina emerges as a complex and difficult character who transcends the attempts of others to mold her to their uses and expectations.

Jakes, and other politically connected, skillfully marketed, and increasingly influential religious leaders. Preaching the "prosperity gospel"???the notion that faith and tithing alone can ensure financial security???both in their churches and over the airwaves, these charismatic leaders scam the gullible even as they enjoy unprecedented access to top Bush Administration officials. Admired by Republican strategists for their antigovernment ideology and authoritarian leadership styles, these televangelists work together to maximize profits; protect themselves legally; influence elections, judicial nominations, and promote their pro-war, apocalyptic ideas.</p></p><p>* GOD'S PROFITS is is a fascinating and important investigation into the sordid nexus between religious zealotry and run-amok capitalism. Sarah Posner has given us a vivid account of a new generation of spiritual hucksters whose venality is nearly matched by their political influence. The story she tells is appalling, but the way she tells it is enormously compelling. --- Michelle Goldberg --- <p>* Sarah Posner has produced the definitive expose of America's leading "prosperity gospel" preachers. With direct access to the Bush White House and Republican lawmakers, these televangelists have injected their Armageddon-based agenda into U.S. foreign policy. Posner's book should serve as a stark warning to anyone tempted to dismiss the John Hagees and Rod Parsleys of the world as benign loons. --- Max Blumenthal --- </p><p>* Sarah Posner's reporting on the religious right is dogged, informed, and ceaselessly illuminating. She never condescends to rank-and-file believers; at the same time, she never excuses their leaders' hypocrisies or fundamental misunderstanding of, and threat to, our constitutional republic. --- Michael Tomasky --- </p><p>* Sarah Posner introduces us to the stars of a new evangelical movement who have declared welfare Satanic, poverty a religious curse, and redistribution of wealth "contrary to the word of God." GOD'S PROFITS serves as an urgent warning about their toxic and corrupting effect on American politics. --- Esther Kaplan --- </p><p>* GOD'S PROFITS is an astounding tale of religious hucksterism--and its role in politics--as big and crass as the ostentatious empires of the Word of Faith movement itself. It features a cast of charlatans, demagogues, con men, and the pols and presidents who pander to them. It is also a window on the rise of the Bush family dynasty and details how John Hagee, Rod Parsley, and their ilk treat faith as a cheap political commodity on its behalf. --- Frederick Clarkson ---</p>Joe Conason is the national correspondent for the "New York Observer," where he writes a political column that is distrubuted by the United Features Syndicate.

In this informative look at an unusual animal, Lasky introduces readers to the lifestyles and habits of lemurs by following primatologist Alison Jolly and her team of researchers. Interesting comparisons between lemurs and humans are drawn along the way: packs claim turf using tactics similar to gang warfare; a mother lemur grieves when a baby is killed. The researchers' awe and wonder will captivate readers, as will their tracking methods. But the real attraction is the furry curiosities themselves. Photos contributed by Christopher Knight perfectly capture the creatures, though the book's lackluster design doesn't do the pictures justice. The afterword, which explains how the lemurs figure into Madagascar's ecological balance, might have been better placed at the front of the book, but that won't stop animal lovers from enjoying the latest effort by a respected writer-photographer team. <i>Kathleen Squires</i></p><h2>1984</h2><p><p>It is <em>1984</em>, and the worlds' three major powers-Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia-are constantly at war.

He was a Trappist monk, writer, and peace and civil rights activist. His bestselling books include <em>The Seven-Storey Mountain, New Seeds of Contemplation,</em> and <em>Mystics and Zen Masters.</em> </p>Like the first two volumes of Merton's journals, this third volume is full of insight into his life and work. Readers will be grateful that when it came to his journals, Merton's Trappist silence did not leave him speechless. In a 1956 entry, he notes that he had "always wanted to write about everything" --not to write a book that "covers everything" or contains everything, but "a book in which everything can go." The journals accomplish this largely by avoiding what he refers to (in a 1958 entry) as "the apostolate of alienation and hatred," a "mania for making everyone else like oneself." Merton's great gift, which shines through in the bits and pieces of his journals even more than in his finished work, is an ability to listen and respond to a world in which everything does go. Lawrence Cunningham notes in his introduction that Merton's journals are full of reflection on what it means to be a monk. In this volume, as in the second one, that reflection plays a major role in shaping his discernment of the world and his place in it. This volume maintains the high standards established in the first two and will leave readers anxiously anticipating the remaining four. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>A Dash of Daring: Carmel Snow and Her Life In Fashion, Art, and Letters</h2><p>Carmel Snow, who changed the course of our culture by launching the careers of some of today's greatest figures in fashion and the arts, was one of the most extraordinary women of the twentieth century.

Yeats</p><p></p></blockquote><p>"It could be happening" is the time-honored way that the Irish stories begin, and the story of Carmel Snow, who just may have been the greatest fashion editor ever, begins in a way that is about as Irish as any story could possibly get -- at least one that played out in New York and, crucially, in Paris, far more extensively than in Ireland. It could be happening that in Dalkey, a coastal village eight miles southeast of Dublin, one evening in 1887 -- August 27, to be exact -- labor pains caused a respectable matron named Annie White to rise up, as majestic as an ocean liner, from the table where a convivial, family-packed dinner party was taking place.</p><p>Dressed in one of the tentlike, floor-length gowns of the day, her habitual train sweeping behind her, this huge-breasted, amply built woman climbed into a waiting carriage, her youthful-looking husband, Peter White, in tow, and headed home to Saint Justin's, their large house overlooking the slate-blue Dublin Bay, where she gave birth to a spritelike creature, their third child and younger daughter, whom the couple piously named for Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The infant was baptized a week later at the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dalkey, a tiny, picturesque town that would be later known for its artistic inhabitants, James Joyce and George Bernard Shaw among them, but was then a fairly sleepy place, ancient in origin, and home to not just one castle but two.</p><p>The child's earliest years were spent in a constellation of six children in an atmosphere that a relative described as "both Chippendale and cottage." Carmel's parents had married in September 1883, in yet another Dublin suburb, Rathmines. Their union had been quickly blessed with a child -- Tom was born just over a year later -- and from then on others arrived in quick succession. Christine Mary came next, in July 1886, and then Carmel, whose middle name was also Mary, the following summer. Three other children -- Peter Desmond (known as Desmond), Victor Gerald, and James -- followed, all of them male and spaced about a year apart. The last was born in 1892.</p><p>Annie White's branch of the family was the more prominent one -- "Chippendale," if you will; her father was a prosperous merchant named Thomas Mayne who later served as a member of Parliament for eighteen years. Peter White's side, the "cottage" one, was literally more down to earth: his late father, also named Thomas, had been a farmer. From both directions, the children were inescapably Irish -- never an uncomplicated thing to be.</p><p>Ireland had been a "lordship" of the English crown since it was conquered by that country in the 1100s. Over the centuries, the extent of its Englishness had waxed and waned. By the time the young Whites were born, Irish nationalist feelings were running strong. Charles Stuart Parnell and other leaders were campaigning for home rule, which called for increased autonomy from Britain. It was a cause that Thomas Mayne, Annie White's father, whom an American newspaper described as belonging "to the old guard of Irish patriots," vehemently supported. His son-in-law, Peter White, born of the soil, was also a Parnellite, And he counted a prominent activist of the era, Michael Davitt, among his friends. (Davitt was, in fact, the Whites' landlord in Dalkey.)</p><p>A photograph, probably taken in the early 1890s, shows Peter White to be a handsome, solidly built fellow with light eyes, a long mustache -- almost a requirement of the era -- and a deep cleft in his chin, something he seems to have bequeathed to many of his male descendants. He was Irish to the core. In his work for the Irish Woolen Manufacturing and Export Company in Dublin, he aimed to resurrect a once-thriving national industry that, thanks to stiff tariffs and competition, notably from Scotland, had been in danger of dying out. Harris tweed had long eclipsed Donegal.</p><p>Ironically, by building a reputation for reviving dying industries in a country that seemed full of them, White ensured that his children's lives would unfold outside of Ireland. But none of that was clear, of course, when he was asked by the viceroy of Ireland, Lord Aberdeen, and his wife, the former Ishbel (the Gaelic variation of Isabel) Maria Marjoribanks, to be honorary secretary of the Irish Industries Association. (Lady Aberdeen was its president.)</p><p>It was once again, as it had so often been, a desperate time for Ireland, and the Aberdeens were determined to help. Together, they came up with a plan to use the small, craftsy things -- from lacework to bog wood ornaments -- that had been produced forever in Ireland's far-flung cottages and convents to turn the country's fortunes around. Besides reviving the country's traditional crafts, they wanted also to provide training in their production, thereby ensuring that some of its desperate citizenry had at least piecemeal work. Along the way, it was hoped, Ireland's image would be enhanced. "Irish goods were not sought after by the people who wanted the best things" is the delicate way the New York Times phrased the matter (in a 1911 article), "but in 1886, with the coming to Dublin of the Earl of Aberdeen, a movement for improving and extending the sale of Irish products began to take hold."</p><p>A Scotsman, Lord Aberdeen had recently been appointed to his post by the English Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. Newly in love with Ireland, he and his wife went straight to work on the seemingly intractable problems of their new country. For Ishbel, it was second nature to throw herself into a cause. Like her husband, she was the product of an aristocratic Scottish family. Born in 1857, she possessed a first-class intellect (she was said to have taught herself to read at the age of three) that, sadly, can't quite be described as irrepressible. While she longed to go to Girton College, Cambridge University's only school for women -- in truth, the perfect place for her -- she was prevented from doing so by her very traditional father. After her marriage, in 1877, Ishbel began what would become her life's work, aiding the poor. There seemed to be no limit to her charity.</p><p>The Emerald Isle was "still in the grip of poverty such as America has never known, not even in a depression," as Carmel later described it. It was rife with struggle of one sort or another. While the great famines of earlier in the century had subsided, the country was still reeling from an agricultural crisis that had climaxed in the 1870s. Much of its population was desperately poor. And the home rule struggle seemed perpetual; anarchy, or at least violence, flared up intermittently, notably after the Land League was banned in 1881. "Ireland is laid on us to do all in our power for her forever," Ishbel wrote in her diary. Before long, she and Peter White were putting in time on the country's unpaved, back-country roads, tirelessly scouting out both crafts and workers.</p><p>Peter White was perfect for the job. He was charismatic and hardworking, and he didn't hesitate to deploy his considerable charm in the service of the mission at hand. Before too long, he was making frequent trips to the United States, something he'd first done in the name of Irish wool. An article in the Citizen, a Chicago newspaper, gives an indication of how breathlessly this dashing Irishman -- still in his thirties -- was received in the New World. "Ireland never selected a more fortunate representative than Mr. Peter White," it reads. "His amiable and sensitive manner wins confidence everywhere."</p><p>For all their love of the place, the Aberdeens didn't last long in Ireland. They were just one domino in a row of them, and they all toppled over, one after another, in a long, jagged line. First, home rule lost in the House of Commons. Then Gladstone's Liberal Party collapsed. Its prime minister was out. And so, of course, were the Aberdeens. But in their time across the Irish Sea, they'd won over the desperate populace. As they headed back to England, people lined the streets, some weeping extravagantly; at one point, the couple's horses were unhitched and their carriage pulled along, ecstatically, by the crowd. "The scene in Dublin on his leavetaking after the fall of the Gladstone cabinet is said to have been such as never before witnessed since the days of O'Connel," the <i>Chicago Times</i> reported. The Aberdeens returned this loyalty by continuing their various pro-Irish endeavors after they'd returned home.</p><p>In 1888, when announcement was made that the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 -- soon to be known universally, if not correctly, as the Chicago World's Fair -- was being put together, the Aberdeens seized the moment, heading to the United States with both Whites in tow to raise money to finance an exhibit of Irish exports at the fair, which Peter White would organize and oversee. For the next few years, he and Lady Aberdeen traveled all over Ireland, visiting workers and meeting with officials, including the lord mayor of Dublin, to build support for the project. White made several visits to Chicago, and by 1892 had acquired the fairly grand title of Irish commissioner to the World's Fair.</p><p>The Aberdeens hoped to return to Ireland if Gladstone returned to power. But when he did, in 1892, some last-minute political maneuvering resulted in someone else being named Ireland's viceroy instead. As a consolation prize, the prime minister awarded Aberdeen the post of governor general of Canada. The Irish Pavilion would go forward, but with much less involvement from the Aberdeens.</p><p>In February 1893, just a few months before the fair was to open, White and Lady Aberdeen set out for one last tour, this time to the South "to pick the 'colleens' who would represent the Irish industries," as Carmel wrote. But then, as it so often does in Irish tales, death played its hand. White had already had lung trouble -- the whole family tended toward t...</p></p><h2>What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins</h2><p>Do goldfish really have a three-second memory?

And where is Merry's police detective colleague, the shiftless Matt Bailey, who vanished the night Santorski died?<br><br>Over the objections of her fianc� Peter, Merry flies back to the island in the teeth of a nor'easter to start the investigation into the scalloper's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as she questions Santorski's co-workers, friends, and housemates, the truth of the scalloper's character seems ever more elusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Jay an honest and caring friend--or a sneak thief? Did he really use heroin, or was he a health-conscious triathlete who feared addictive drugs? Why did he drop out of Harvard so suddenly, when marine biology meant so much to him? And why did he die with the missing Matt Bailey's phone number in his pocket?<br><br>Dead ends and false leads confront Merry at every turn--and Police Chief John Folger is behind too many of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Merry delves further into the mystery of Jay Santorski, she feels increasingly isolated.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, she cannot trust her lifelong role model--her own father.<br><br>Forced to continue her search alone, Merry plunges into Jay's private world--a world of warring obsessions...between truth and seduction, addiction and redemption, between two women vying for possession of his soul: Hannah Moore, the brilliant and ruthless marine biologist, and Margot St. John, a blues singer with a mortal habit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them stands Owen Harley, Jay's friend and employer, a man with some obsessions of his own.<br><br>To learn what really happened in the midnight waters off Old North Wharf, Merry must confront the truth of her own past.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a case that will test her loyalties and strain her ties to the people she loves most.&nbsp;&nbsp;What, finally, is more important--her need for justice, or for Peter Mason? Should she shield her father, or force him to shoulder his share of the blame? When a second body is found, her choice becomes agonizingly clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry cannot allow a dangerous killer to strike again....</p><p>During Nantucket's annual Christmas Stroll, the island's shop windows are filled with quaint wool blankets and antique barometers in an attempt to add some holiday cheer (and tourist dollars) to the area by encouraging wealthy mainlanders out to the island. But when a boatload of tourists rolls by a floating corpse on the way into town, it puts an inevitable damper on the festivities. <p> The drowned body turns out to be that of a young Harvard scholar-turned-scalloper with needle marks in his arm, and Merry is called home from vacation by her father, police chief John Folger, to investigate the drug-induced accident. Investigate an accident? Merry decides her father must know more than he's telling and, with a quick stop at the morgue, her hunch is confirmed. How did her father know to look for the pinprick-sized needle marks in the man's upper arm? Why did her father so confidently mention heroin as the cause of death when the patient's autopsy suggests otherwise: the pupil in his one remaining eye is dilated rather than constricted, the usual sign of heroin use. </p><p> Merry's fully aware of her precarious situation. By solving the case, she'll most likely uncover the damaging evidence that her father's withholding; by failing to solve it, she'll lose her father's professional respect, which Merry's afraid she may have already lost after having botched her last homicide case. But she can't stop puzzling over one question: Why would a man with something to hide want his own daughter to investigate the case? </p><p> Mathews has used the Nantucket backdrop to full effect; the island's raw, blustery weather sets an eerie scene, whether it's during a young woman's phone call to her dead friend or when two teenagers dredge up scallops and some revealing jetsam. Mathews may have tried to cover too much ground in <i>Death in a Cold Hard Light</i>, bringing Merry's professional credibility as well as her relationship with her father and her soon-to-be fianc� into the picture, but the book is at its most intriguing when it focuses on the puzzling case itself. <i>--Kris Law</i></p>Praise for Francine Mathews's previous Nantucket mystery <i>Death in A Mood Indigo:</i><p>"Outstanding...Francine Mathews is a dazzling talent indeed.

The present book has evolved out of a key ontological recognition consonant with time-honored metaphysical doctrine. In keeping with a realist view of cognitive sense perception, it rejects the Cartesian dichotomy of res extensa and res cogitans, and obviates what Whitehead referred to as the fallacy of bifurcation. In an earlier book (The Quantum Enigma, 1995) the author established two facts: first, that a consistent non-bifurcationist interpretation of physics can be formulated; and second, that this eliminates at one stroke the various forms of &#34;quantum paradox&#34; resulting from superposition and the so-called collapse of the state vector. The crucial ingredient of the new approach, mandated by the aforesaid recognition, is an ontological distinction between the physical domain, accessed via measurement, and the corporeal, accessed by way of cognitive sense perception. In the present book the author extends this metaphysically-based interpretation from fundamental physics to contemporary cosmology. With the aid of a few additional conceptions consonant, say, with the Thomistic doctrine-such as the concept of what he terms &#34;the extrapolated universe&#34;, or the notion of &#34;vertical causation&#34; relating to intelligent design-he treats a broad range of issues from a unified metaphysical point of view. Not surprisingly, his conclusions tent to be radically at odds with the prevailing interpretations of scientific data, regardless of whether these are based upon naturalistic or scientistically theistic presuppositions. The author&#39;s approach may thus be characterized as the third alternative: the sole option, it appears, consistent with the Aristotelian and Platonist traditions, and with the wisdom of Christianity, as delineated especially in the Patristic writings.</p><p></p><h2>John Thomson: Life and Photographs</h2><p>Gathers nineteenth-century photographs of children, families, workers, dancers, princes, landscapes, and street scenes in Siam, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Cyprus, and London</p><p>The mid-19th century heralded the age of knowledge, and photography was developed as an effective tool for documenting a vast array of global factsfamous and common people, spectacular scenes and mundane activities, monuments, mills, crafts, war, recreation, ceremony. Among the more venturesome and skillful photographers of that time was Britain's John Thomson who camera-explored Siam, Cambodia, Vietnam and South China in the 1860s. That sojourn is the principal subject of this handsome book, which includes vivid and well-crafted photographs of the now-famous ruins at Angkor Wat, Buddhist monasteries, "floating cities," and the court and king of Siam that bring to life a world of mystery and exotic custom. White's critical biography is thoroughly engaging. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this first monograph on Thomson, the photographer emerges as a much fuller figure than was appreciated. Born in Edinburgh in 1837, he left for the Far East in 1862. For ten years he photographed the Orient, equally intrigued by beggars in Foochow, the kings of Siam and Cambodia, tradesmen in Peking, and the exotic look of Formosa. The importance of these images has been overshadowed by Thomson's collaboration, Street Life in London (1877). Now, a traveling exhibition and this fine text with 160 exquisitely reproduced duotone images reveal Thomson's genius as a landscapist and chronicler, an explorer of unphotographed regions, and one who set out to record a people.

A death-row prisoner. An unsuspecting pilgrim. A treacherous friend. Jesus touches each of these and many others seen and unseen on his agony-filled way to the cross. Combining sacred Scripture, storytelling, and personal reflection, The Via Crucis draws readers into a heartfelt and inspiring contemplation of Jesus&#39; sacrifice and his triumphant victory over death.

A beloved disciple. A vacationing passerby. A woman cured. A treacherous friend. Jesus touches each of these and many others&#x2014;seen and unseen&#x2014;on His agony-filled way to the cross. Combining scripture, storytelling, quotations, and personal reflection, The Via Crucis draws readers into a heartfelt and inspiring contemplation of Jesus' sacrifice and His triumphant victory over death.

Deeply moving and personal, the forty devotions work equally well as individual reading or in community worship settings. Inspired by the centuries-old practice of the stations of the cross, The Via Crucis invites contemporary believers to find fresh meaning in contemplation and prayer on what it means to carry the cross and follow Christ.For ten years, Shawn Small was a youth minister in the Dallas metro area. In 1999, he took a year-long sabbatical to find God&#39;s heart for his future. The result of that time was the launching of Wonder Voyage Missions in the year 2000. Wonder Voyage is a unique organization dedicated to educating and leading groups into the ancient Christian practice of pilgrimage and in life-transforming service trips around the world. Shawn has had the privilege of leading hundreds of people to locations around the world that include Wales, Jamaica, Greece, Guatemala, and Peru. Although he leads several retreats a year, Shawn considers himself first and foremost a storyteller. This is his first endeavor at publishing in his unique storytelling style. He and his wife, Cheryl, reside in Flower Mound, Texas. They have four children.</p><h2>Bliss and Other Stories (Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p>&#39;Although Bertha Young was thirty she still had moments like this when she wanted to run instead of walk, to take dancing steps on and off the pavement, to bowl a hoop, to throw something up in the air and catch it again, or to stand still and laugh at - nothing - at nothing, simply&#39;. Katherine Mansfield&#39;s perceptive and resonant writing helped to define the modern short story, observing apparently trivial incidents to create quietly devastating revelations of inner lives. In these three tales, aglow with light and colour, Mansfield describes an exultant epiphany, fading memories and the unspoken, half-understood emotions that make up everyday existence. This book includes &#34;Bliss&#34;, &#34;The Daughters of the Late Colonel&#34; and &#34;The Doll&#39;s House&#34;.</p><p>Born in New Zealand in 1888, Katherine Mansfield Beauchamp was primarily a writer of short stories. She published Prelude and The Garden Party and Other Stories before her premature death from TB in 1923. Something Childish and her journal and letters were published posthumously.Before there were minimalist writers, there were great miniaturists such as Katherine Mansfield, whose work has deceptive power, so cannily and quietly did she craft her scenes. In Mansfield&#39;s stories the level of detail is astonishing, and each central character so fully present that when the climax comes, the listener draws a breath of surprise and simultaneous recognition of the necessary and often painful truths of life. This recording presents six of the thirteen stories originally published together in the 1920s--how lucky we are to have even these six. Each is served up by Juliet Stevenson as a rare delicacy, each character brought forth with perfect accent and timbre, each tale with full awareness of every nuance. The result? The listener is blessed with the good fortune of hearing two great storytellers working in concert, and it is absolute bliss. J.L.B.

These large, colorful works are the capstone of his engagement with nature, not only in England but also in the American Southwest, through the media of painting and photography. This book, the catalog of the first major Hockney museum exhibition in many years, offers a glorious view of the landscape as seen by the artist, and it includes not only his recent paintings but also his iPhone and iPad drawings. Essays by leading art historians&#x2014;as well as a more literary piece by novelist Margaret Drabble and Hockney&#x2019;s own reflections on his recent work&#x2014;explore Hockney&#x2019;s art from various perspectives.</p><p><p><b>Marco Livingstone</b> is an art historian and independent curator and the author of numerous books about postwar art. <b>Margaret Drabble</b> is an English novelist, biographer, and critic. <b>Tim Barringer</b> is the Paul Mellon Professor of the History of Art at Yale University. <b>Xavier Salomon</b> is the curator of Southern Baroque paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. <b>Martin Gayford</b> is a writer focusing on art and jazz.</p></p><h2>The Ordinary Acrobat: A Journey into the Wondrous World of the Circus, Past and Present</h2><p><p>The extraordinary story of a young man&#x2019;s plunge into the unique and wonderful world of the circus&#x2014;taking readers deep into circus history and its renaissance as a contemporary art form, and behind the (tented) walls of France&#x2019;s most prestigious circus school. <br><br> When Duncan Wall visited his first <i>nouveau</i> <i>cirque </i>as a college student in Paris, everything about it&#x2014;the monochromatic costumes, the acrobat singing Simon and Garfunkel, the juggler reciting Proust&#x2014;was captivating. Soon he was waiting outside stage doors, eagerly chatting with the stars, and attending circuses two or three nights a week. So great was his enthusiasm that a year later he applied on a whim to the training program at the �cole Nationale des Arts du Cirque&#x2014;and was, to his surprise, accepted.<br><br> Sometimes scary and often funny, <i>The Ordinary Acrobat</i> follows the (occasionally literal) collision of one American novice and a host of gifted international students in a rigorous regimen of tumbling, trapeze, juggling, and clowning. Along the way, Wall introduces readers to all the ambition, beauty, and thrills of the circus&#x2019;s long history: from hardscrabble beginnings to Gilded Age treasures, and from twentieth-century artistic and economic struggles to its brilliant reemergence in the form of contemporary circus (most prominently through Cirque du Soleil). Readers meet figures past&#x2014;the father of the circus, Philip Astley; the larger-than-life P. T. Barnum&#x2014;and present, as Wall seeks lessons from innovative masters including juggler J�r�me Thomas and clown Andr� Riot-Sarcey. As Wall learns, not everyone is destined to run away with the circus&#x2014;but the institution fascinates just the same.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brimming with surprises, outsized personalities, and plenty of charm, <i>The Ordinary Acrobat</i> delivers all the excitement and pleasure of the circus ring itself.<br></p></p><p>Duncan Wall studied as a Fulbright scholar at France&#x2019;s �cole Nationale des Arts du Cirque de Rosny-sous-Bois. He is on the board of directors for the American Youth Circus Organization and was the founder and co&#x2013;artistic director of the Candidatos, an acclaimed clown-theater company recognized by <i>The</i> New York Times for its contribution to the flowering of contemporary clowning. He lives in Montreal, where he teaches circus history and criticism at the �cole Nationale de Cirque, Canada&#x2019;s national circus school.&nbsp;I arrived in Paris with vague hopes of being thought of as a student rather than a scholar, a circus hopeful like the others in my program. If asked, I would of course tell the truth, but I honestly thought it wouldn&#x2019;t come up. Although I wasn&#x2019;t an acrobat, I was reasonably athletic&#x2014;-I had excelled at sports as a kid and done some rock--climbing in college. And it was, after all, a &#x201c;preparatory&#x201d; program. It would take me less than a class to figure out how hopelessly na�ve I was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arriving to class early, I spent a few minutes milling around with the other students, making small talk. There were only three of them: Maud, Fanny, and Boris. All were French, all about twenty or so. None were particularly impressive physically. Fanny might have stepped out of a Woodstock poster. Her hair was knotted into dreadlocks, and she wore a ragged wool sweater and a pair of cutoff sweatpants, both of which looked voluminous on her tiny frame. Only slightly taller and thinner, Maud flaunted a tongue ring and a panoply of ear piercings. Boris had broad shoulders and a chiseled jaw, but even he didn&#x2019;t seem particularly athletic, more like a soldier than an acrobat. In my white Adidas T--shirt and black track pants, I was feeling confident.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a few minutes, Luc, our paunchy acrobatics professor, arrived. He introduced himself and announced our goal for the day: we would begin with a &#x201c;reference test,&#x201d; a simulation of the school&#x2019;s entrance exam, to gauge our progress over the year. But first, he said, we should take a few minutes to stretch before we got started.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whereupon I hit my first snag. As I lay there on the ground, arms and legs pitched to the side, the hall lights sparking in my eyes, it occurred to me that I had no idea how an acrobat might stretch. My primary sport while growing up had been soccer, and soccer players don&#x2019;t worry much about their arms or their necks.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a temporary solution, I imagined a relief pitcher stretching in a bullpen. I waggled my arm like a dead fish. I pulled my biceps across my chest and gave my arm a good tug. When I had extinguished this line of possibility, I stole a glance over at my cohorts for inspiration. All three of them were gyrating vigorously on the ground, as if engaged in a group Pilates class.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maud was bouncing her nose toward her knees. Boris had rolled over backward, as if trying to catch a whiff of his crotch, and was alternately popping his legs skyward, then lowering them and squeezing his thighs against his chest. Nearest to me, Fanny lay sprawled on her back, sweeping her legs confidently from side to side&#x2014;-right over left, left over right. The cuff of her pants made a percussive swishing against the carpet. Swish, swish. Swish, swish.<br> &nbsp;<br> I decided to give it a shot. Unfolding, as if to make a snow angel, I opened my arms and legs as wide as I could, gave a sigh to expel the air from my lungs, and twisted swiftly at the waist, so that my right leg swept across my left.<br> &nbsp;<br> Immediately, a series of deeply unhealthy cracking sounds cascaded up my spine&#x2014;-pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! I had never heard my body make such sounds before. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Fanny lift her head off the carpet. She eyed me, concerned. &#x201c;Was that your body?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked at her blankly and shrugged as if I didn&#x2019;t know what she was talking about. She scrutinized me and then went back to sweeping her legs. I rolled over for some more arm stretches.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was my first sense that I was out of my league. It would only get worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, who wants to go first?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stretching complete, Luc had summoned us to the spring--loaded runway, where he lounged on a black cube, a clipboard on his knee. Our &#x201c;reference test,&#x201d; he had explained, would consist of a series of acrobatic movements, from basic to difficult. We would have three shots at each. Luc would score each movement: 0 was for not attempting, 5 for perfect. We would start with a basic somersault. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; he coaxed again, &#x201c;somebody has to start.&#x201d; Maud emerged from our pack.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had chatted a bit with her before class. She was dainty, with blond hair styled in a pixie cut, a button nose, and green eyes that sparked energetically. She seemed kind and a bit shy. Recounting her experience working as a mascot at Disneyland Paris, she had rolled her eyes, covered her mouth, and laughed an endearing, airy laugh.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as Maud assumed her position at the head of the runway, there was a demonstrable shift in her demeanor. While Luc repeated the instructions&#x2014;-three somersaults per pass&#x2014;-she bounced on her toes and jiggled her arms like a sprinter prepping to settle into the blocks. Gone was tender Maud, the Disneyland Daisy. In her stead was someone darker and fiercer. Toeing the line, she gave a soldierly nod and exhaled sharply, almost snorting. Then she sprang.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a spring to behold. With her chin tucked, her toes pointed, and her whole frame taut, Maud arched through the air. Curling just before she hit the ground, she rolled and emerged on her feet, finishing with a little hop, her hands in the air. She paused only momentarily before pouncing again through a second somersault, then a third, each as flawless as the first, like a porpoise cutting waves.<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt myself shudder. This wasn&#x2019;t rumpus room; it was Romanian. In the course of her young life, Maud had probably performed hundreds if not thousands of somersaults. To calm myself, I looked to the other students. They seemed unimpressed. Boris had bent over for some toe touches. Fanny was unraveling a loose seam on her sweatpants.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Next!&#x201d; called Luc sluggishly</p><h2>Garden of Evil: A Britt Montero Novel</h2><p>In the intense heat of an oppressive Miami summer, crime reporter Britt Montero is ice cold, her writing relegated to the inner pages of the daily that employs her. But now there&#39;s a hot story she&#39;s just dying to get her hands on. A female serial slayer is luring men with sex, then mutilating and murdering them with a bullet that bears traces of her lipstick. Dubbed the &#34;Kiss Me Killer,&#34; she has already murdered a sheriff and a powerful politician, among others, with her unique &#34;kiss of death.&#34; Britt is determined to own the fatal femme&#39;s story. But it can only come at a deadly price, as a face-to-face meet goes explosively bad. And suddenly Britt Montero is the news, trapped in the company of a psychopath on a terrifying odyssey through the darkest heart of the Sunshine State...and heading straight to Hell.</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

As a Pulitzer Prize-winning crime reporter, Buchanan has exposed the seamier sides of this sun-drenched paradise, then used her more than twenty years of experience to create a dynamic and deadly Miami that vividly comes alive in each of her novels. Especially when the city is seen through the fiercely intense eyes of a tough newspaperwoman named Britt Montero. The author of eleven books, Buchanan has spent time behind bars -- with two serial killers. She lives in Miami, Florida.</p><h2>Caprice and Rondo: The Seventh Book in the House of Niccolo (House of Niccolo/Dorothy Dunnett)</h2><p>Winter, 1474: In the frozen port of Danzig, Nicholas de Fleury, one-time soldier, merchant, and banker to kings, leads his raffish companions on frivolous, drunken adventures that give little indication of the dark and complex events that have brought him among them--his activities as a spy; his shifts of allegiance from the Duke of Burgundy to the Holy Roman Emperor, and back; the mischief-making at the court of Scotland so vicious that his disgusted friends cast him into justifiable exile.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In six vivid novels (synopsized in an introduction to this volume), the peerless Dorothy Dunnett has shown us Nicholas's progress from humble dyeworks apprentice to merchant prince with his own private army, consultant to duchies and kingdoms--even as he strives to understand his origins and to come to terms with his independent, contrary wife, Gelis. And now, as the ice melts in Danzig, Nicholas must decide his own future: Will he make a new life working for the Italian colonies of the Levant? Or assist the great Muslim prince Uzum Hasan in his stance against the Turks? Will he remain in Poland, trading and fighting, or lose himself in the secret, scented gardens of the Crimea? In fact, he could appear to be doing any or all of these things while engaged in his private search for a lost fortune in gold . . .<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas has an unmapped future as Caprice and Rondo begins, yet whatever he chooses to do, he is still bound, as if by an invisible thread, to the men and women he has left behind. As always, he obliquely tries to protect them from their enemies and his own . . . and they in turn begin to learn more about his past. Nicholas will choose, and he will act. But as the military and political lines form and the great battle is launched to decide the dominance of Europe, his personal struggle for redemption and return will also be resolved--if it is not already too late.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caprice and Rondo, like its predecessors in the House of Niccol� sequence, offers a rare and perfect evocation of the fifteenth century, with all its pageantry, excitement, and brutal reality. The intricately twisting narrative challenges and absorbs the reader-- as England's Birmingham Post said of an earlier volume: "You move into another world: one of beauty and intrigue, love and hate, wit and breathtaking adventure." In short, from an author beloved by legions of readers, everything one could want in a novel.</p><p>Mistress of several languages, both ancient and modern, and of many literatures and philosophies, Dunnett produces writing that is informed, formal and flawless . . . Opulent descriptions, witty repartee, gripping duels and battle scenes, ebullient practical jokes, and smoldering sexuality crowd the chapters with a life so full of color and intensity that it leaps off the pages . . . Dunnett has been called "the finest living writer of historical fiction" by the <i>Washington Post</i>, and it is not an exaggeration.<br>--Nora Marsh, <i> New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>"Dazzling--dense, intelligent and subtle--Dunnett has fashioned a vast tale firmly set in her grasp of the early Renaissance world." --Newsday<br><br>"Tantalizing--fascinating--a remarkable variety of situations present the reader with complex and volatile imaginings.....The finest living writer of historical fiction." --The Washington Post Book World</p><h2>Nobody Cares Who You Are: Book III: The Panic Years, Part I</h2><p><p>Nobody cares who you are; it was a sentiment I became all too familiar with as I was growing up. It's what the city of Detroit was all about. But by the time I met the boys of Widespread Panic in October of 1987, I didn't give a damn that nobody cared who I was. By then, I had found the music, and a group of boys who were about to show me just how powerful that music could be. From that point forward, the only thing I cared about was living, breathing, and sleeping with the sound. And the boys of Widespread Panic showed me exactly how to do that.</p></p><p></p><h2>The A-Z of Three-Wheelers: A definitive reference guide since 1769</h2><p>Love them or loathe them the three-wheeler, Cycle-car or even Tri-car, has had an important impact in the development of the present day motor car. From the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution to the concept cars of the future, these vehicles can hold their headlamps up with pride. They were present at the birth of motoring and possibly may be the answer to the future with the constant depletion of the Earth's energy resources. <p>The first self-propelled vehicle in the world was a steam powered three-wheeler developed by Frenchman Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769 with, over a century later in 1885, a Benz three-wheeler being the first recognized machine to be powered by a gasoline engine. </p><p> From pioneering machines such as John Knight's 1896 Petroleum Tricycle and Nazi scientist Count S. von Teleki's WWII Bubble Puppy to the modern sporting vehicles of Razor Cars and the iconic Morgan three-wheeler, this fascinating chronicle covers over 1,000 models from more than 450 manufacturers. </p><p> Vehicles from such varied manufacturers as Allard Clipper, Br�tsch, Heinkel, Singer and Zundapp, combine with the innovative 1933 Dymaxion built streamlined three-wheeler, Daihatsu delivery trucks, the 1938 USA built Trimobile and Reliant's much-loved Robin to bring to light the story of hundreds of remarkable three-wheeled vehicles. </p><p> Organized by manufacturer including full details of all models and over 470 photographs, together with an introduction by Charles Morgan of the Morgan Motor Company, <i>The A-Z of Three-Wheelers</i> is a comprehensive guide to this classic mode of transport.</p></p><p>Elvis' interest in 3-wheelers began in 1990 when prior to going to university his motorcycle was stolen and he purchased his first Reliant Robin that at the time could be driven on a motorcycle licence.

In 2000 Elvis set up 3-wheelers.com which is now possibly the largest web site on 3-wheeled cars on the Internet.

In her latest, <i>Ritual</i>, Hayder gives us a taut, chilling tale of clandestine occult practices, New Age medicine, and the drug underground, set in a hypermodern urban landscape challenged by colliding immigrant cultures.<br>Just after lunch on a Tuesday in April, nine feet under water, police diver Flea Marley closes her gloved fingers around a human hand. The fact that there's no body attached is disturbing enough. Even more disturbing is the discovery, a day later, of the matching hand. Both have been recently amputated, and the indications are that the victim was still alive when they were removed. DI Jack Caffery has been newly seconded to the Major Crime Investigation Unit in Bristol. He and Flea soon establish that the hand belong to a young man who has recently disappeared. Their search for him&#x2014;and for his abductor&#x2014;lead them into the darkest recesses of Bristol's underworld, where drug addiction is rife, where street-kids sell themselves for a hit, and where one of Africa's most disturbing rituals may be making an unexpected appearance.</p><p><p>MO HAYDER is the author of <em>Birdman</em>, <em>The Treatment</em>, <em>The Devil of Nanking</em>, <em>Pig Island</em>, <em>Ritual</em>, <em>Skin</em> and <em>Gone</em>, all of which have been international bestsellers.

The setting is Bristol, England, where police diving expert &#x201c;Flea&#x201d; Marley is called in to investigate after a human hand is found in the Avon river. The discovery links Flea with burned-out detective Jack Caffery&#x2014;the lead in both Birdman (1999), Hayder&#x2019;s first novel, and The Treatment&#x2014;and sets the pair on a journey into England&#x2019;s heroin subculture. Following&nbsp;a trail that becomes darker with every turn, they move relentlessly toward a confrontation with practitioners of muthi, a form of African witchcraft that uses human body parts for healing and spell-casting rituals. Hayder has long been a master at blending crime and horror genres, but this time she outdoes herself, flip-flopping the supernatural and the explainable like a cycle of poison and antidote that will remain with the reader long after the final page. Superviolent, but for those with strong stomachs, completely gripping. --Elliott Swanson</p><h2>Cooked: From the Streets to the Stove, from Cocaine to Foie Gras</h2><p><p>Jeff Henderson was just another inner-city black kid born into a world of poverty and limited options, where crime seemed to provide the only way to get out. Raised mostly by his single mother, who struggled just to keep food on the table, Jeff dreamed big. He had to get out and he soon did by turning to what so many in his community did: dealing drugs. But Jeff was no ordinary drug dealer; by twenty-one, he was one of the top cocaine dealers in San Diego, making up to $35,000 a week. Two years later he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges and sentenced to almost twenty years in prison. Before he knew what had hit him, he was looking at spending most of his life behind bars. The street life had been the only one he'd ever known and even incarcerated he was too hardheaded to realize that no good would come of it.</p><p>That is, until he was assigned to one of the least desirable prison jobs: washing dishes. That job helped turn his whole life around. It gave him access to the prison kitchen and he became fascinated watching his fellow prisoners cook for the thousands of other inmates and prison officials. Henderson learned to cook in prison. Not cocaine, but food. And his dream was born: Once outside, he would become a chef.</p><p>It was a tough, seemingly impossible journey for an ex-con. Few chefs would give him the opportunity to cook in their restaurants. And once hired, he endured racism and sabotage in the kitchen. But Henderson refused to accept rejection. Driven by a dream and an unshakable will to succeed, Chef Jeff worked hard to overcome unimaginable adversity and eventually reached the top of his profession, becoming executive chef at Caf� Bellagio in Las Vegas.</p><p>Alive with the energy of the streets, the sober reality of prison, and the visceral thrill of being inside the fast-paced kitchens of great restaurants, <em>Cooked</em> is an intense, intimate tale of crime, punishment, and redemption&#x2014;a deeply poignant story of how the worst wrong can lead to the most extraordinary right.</p></p><p><p>Award-winning chef Jeff Henderson made history in Las Vegas when he became the first African-American executive chef at the world-renowned Bellagio Hotel. In fall 2008, his own TV show will debut on the Food Network and his first cookbook, <em>Chef Jeff Cooks</em>, will also be published. Chef Jeff lives in Las Vegas with his wife, Stacy, and their three children.</p>How one of San Diego's most successful cocaine dealers became an award-winning chef [...] is the question that drives this sporadically inspired memoir. Henderson got his start dealing when his family moved to San Diego and he fell in with two street thugs. At age 25, after amassing a small fortune in drug money, Henderson was arrested, convicted and sentenced to 19 years in prison; once there, he discovered a love for cooking that gave him much-needed direction. After serving nine years, Henderson got an early release and began a series of grueling, occasionally demeaning jobs in kitchens, eventually working his way up to leading roles in Caesars Palace Hotel and elsewhere. Unfortunately, Henderson's story rings truest before he turns to the culinary; the fascinating level of detail in his description of the drug trade dissipates when it comes to the intricacies of working in and running a kitchen, lending his redemption a hollow feel. In addition, Henderson's casual reference to methods and equipment particular to the industry may leave amateur foodies nonplussed. While Henderson's achievements deserve recognition, this rushed retelling makes it difficult to fully appreciate his hard work. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet competition is in fact a <em>good</em> thing because it&#x2019;s about working toward excellence.</p><p><em>Finish First</em> is a wake-up call for business leaders, entrepreneurs, spouses, parents, and even students to stop settling for mediocre and begin to revitalize their intrinsic will to achieve excellence and go for the win. Most of us feel we were made for something more, but we&#x2019;re often afraid to allow ourselves to be competitive because we think our finishing first might somehow rob others of their chance to shine. This book encourages the hidden potential, the champion within all of us, to come out&#x2014;which eventually brings our family, marriage, career, business, and the world around us the greatest possible good.</p></p><p><p>Scott Hamilton is a living example of good guys who finish first. He is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, Olympic champion, cancer survivor, broadcaster, motivational speaker, author, husband, father, eternal optimist, and firm believer that the only disability in life is a bad attitude. For more than twenty years, Scott has inspired audiences around the world with the story of his life and how he has overcome adversities. He lives near Nashville with his beautiful wife, Tracie, and their four amazing children.</p></p><h2>Front-Page Girls: Women Journalists in American Culture and Fiction, 1880&#x2013;1930</h2><p><p>The first study of the role of the newspaperwoman in American literary culture at the turn of the twentieth century, this book recaptures the imaginative exchange between real-life reporters like Nellie Bly and Ida B. Wells and fictional characters like Henrietta Stackpole, the lady-correspondent in Henry James's <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>. It chronicles the exploits of a neglected group of American women writers and uncovers an alternative reporter-novelist tradition that runs counter to the more familiar story of gritty realism generated in male-dominated newsrooms. </p><p>Taking up actual newspaper accounts written by women, fictional portrayals of female journalists, and the work of reporters-turned-novelists such as Willa Cather and Djuna Barnes, Jean Marie Lutes finds in women's journalism a rich and complex source for modern American fiction. Female journalists, cast as both standard-bearers and scapegoats of an emergent mass culture, created fictions of themselves that far outlasted the fleeting news value of the stories they covered.</p><p><i>Front-Page Girls </i>revives the spectacular stories of now-forgotten newspaperwomen who were not afraid of becoming the news themselves&#x2015;the defiant few who wrote for the city desks of mainstream newspapers and resisted the growing demand to fill women's columns with fashion news and household hints. It also examines, for the first time, how women's journalism shaped the path from news to novels for women writers.</p></p><p>"Front-Page Girls is conspicuously well written. The prose is clear, vivid, and sophisticated while sustaining a high degree of complexity in the analysis. The cultural history Lutes presents is compelling and important. She is an exceptionally skillful critic and interpreter and is able to combine close readings of textual passages with persuasive arguments about the cultural significance of women in journalism."--Nancy Bentley, University of Pennsylvania <p>"Jean Marie Lutes challenges accounts linking the developing standard of journalistic objectivity to the emergence of realist fiction, both of which were seen as male domains. In so doing she adds a new aspect to the story: how women journalists-both white and African American-contributed to journalism and to literary culture. "--Elizabeth Faue, Wayne State University </p><p>"Front-Page Girls is a splendid addition to the literature of journalism and literary history from the perspective of women's studies. This seminal work provides a much-needed examination of the careers of American women journalists in fact and fiction from 1880 to 1930 by merging literary and journalism history. It points out that women journalists, long trivialized as stunt girls and sob sisters, played important roles in a mass-produced commodity culture that marketed their own femininity along with their news stories. Studying the intersections of race, class, and gender in depicting women journalists, Lutes makes a convincing case that they have not been given the attention they deserve from scholars who have overlooked their significance as symbols of contested womanhood. She tells a compelling tale of women who personified both authorship and spectacle as they entered a new world of publicity and power dominated by images of their bodies as emblems of women's place in a modern America."--Maurine Beasley, University of Maryland, College Park</p><p>Jean Marie Lutes is Assistant Professor of English at Villanova University.</p></p><h2>The Black Sheep&#39;s Redemption (Fitzgerald Bay, 5)</h2><p><br><br>Everyone in Fitzgerald Bay&#x2014;except his law-enforcement family&#x2014;is convinced Charles Fitzgerald murdered his children's nanny. Condemned by public opinion, his only hope for a replacement nanny to take care of his two-year-old twins is newcomer Demi Taylor. But Demi has problems of her own...starting with amnesia. She doesn't remember who she is, doesn't know where she's from&#x2014;and has no idea why she always feels like someone is watching her. Is she in danger because of Charles? Or has someone sinister from her old life found her yet again?<br><br></p><p>Lynette Eason lives in Simpsonville, SC with her husband and two children.

Her book fell to the floor. Heart thumping, she bolted from the couch and spun to look at the window. She'd had it cracked to let in the sound of the ocean crashing on the cliffs just below the house but the blinds were closed and blocked her view. Which was good.<p>If she couldn't see out, no one could see in. Quickly, she moved the blinds, shut the window and latched it. Heart still racing, she simply stared at it for a moment as she told herself to calm down. Absently, she shoved up her wire-rimmed glasses back on her nose.</p><p>What would someone be doing anywhere near that window? Or was she just being silly and it was a tree branch knocking against the pane?</p><p>After all, this was her first week on the job as nanny to Charles Fitzgerald's children and she wasn't used to the night sounds of this house. A shiver danced across her skin, raising goose bumps and her blood pressure.</p><p>She walked to the front door and checked the lock.</p><p>Secured.</p><p>Pulling the curtain covering the small window to the left, she parted the blinds and peered out into the dark night. The motion-activated floodlights weren't on which meant no one had moved in front of them.</p><p>She breathed a little easier, her heart rate slowed and she could almost laugh at her jumpiness.</p><p>It was only eight-thirty. Her new employer should be home any minute. She'd agreed to stay late while he made a house call, but she wasn't sure she liked it.</p><p>Ever since waking up in the hospital three weeks ago with no real memory of who she was, or where she belonged, Demi quickly found out she didn't like the dark.</p><p>The fact that no one had come forward to identify her even after her face had been all over the news and in the paper was a bitter pill to swallow. Starting over in Fitzgerald Bay, Massachusetts, had seemed like a good idea last week and getting a job almost immediately had seemed like a dream come true.</p><p>Now, doubt assailed her.</p><p>She peered out again. The inky blackness made her shiver. Charles and his family lived in the Fitzgerald Bay lighthouse keeper's residence, but even the lighthouse beam didn't reach far enough to cut through the dark.</p><p>All Demi knew was that darkness brought flashes of pain, screams, angry words and what she thought was a memory of heavy fists. But that was all she could pull from her shuttered mind before the pounding headache drilled into her, forcing her to abandon her efforts to remember.</p><p>No, she didn't like the dark. Add in the weird noises and her adrenaline had stayed spiked since Charles had left three hours ago. A fine tremble set in and she clenched her fingers into fists.</p><p>She stood still, eyes closed.</p><p>And listened.</p><p>Maybe it was just her imagination.</p><p>At night, in her small apartment above The Reading Nook bookstore in town, she often thought she heard footsteps outside her door. Lurking, hiding.</p><p>But every time she checked, no one was ever there.</p><p>Maybe&#x2014;</p><p>Another scrape against the house made her jerk. Then a muffled pop caused her to gasp. What was going on? This was <i>not</i> her imagination.</p><p>She made her way into the kitchen and closed the blinds. Standing next to the window with the blinds now shut, she thought she heard a footfall, a rattle.</p><p>And another pop.</p><p>A muffled curse.</p><p>Her breathing quickened once again and her heart picked up speed.</p><p>Someone was definitely near the garage. What should she do? Get the kids? Hide? The phone.</p><p>She needed to call the police. And Charles.</p><p>Trembling, knees almost knocking, she slapped the light switch on the wall and threw the room into total darkness.</p><p>A shudder ripped through her as she thought about the children sleeping down the hall. What if the person was trying to get into the house?</p><p>She had to protect the children.</p><p>Fighting the fear threatening to cripple her, she groped for the handset of the cordless phone on the counter beside the refrigerator.</p><p>The cool plastic slid into her palm and she felt for the digits. 9-1-1.</p><p>Lifting it to her ear, she waited, heart thudding so hard she wondered if she'd be able to hear the dispatcher. "9-1-1, what's your emergency?"</p><p>"Someone's outside the house," she whispered. "Charles Fitzgerald's home. I think he's trying to get in."</p><p>"Ma'am, stay on the line. Can you get somewhere to hide?"</p><p>"No. I'm responsible for two children sleeping in two different rooms. If I wake them to hide... The noise they would make... No."</p><p>"Someone is on the way, ma'am, just stay on the line."</p><p>Demi did as the woman said, while the garage door drew her attention. It was closed, yet she peered out anyway to find the space empty. But the door.</p><p>It moved. Rattled.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she said, "He's by the garage."</p><p>"Help is coming." A pause. "Is Dr. Fitzgerald there?"</p><p>"No, I'm his nanny. I'm staying here with the children while he made a house call."</p><p>Another pause that seemed like a lifetime. Then, "I've alerted Detective Owen Fitzgerald, Charles's brother, that there's trouble at your location. He's on his way."</p><p>"Thank you." Still the fear churned inside her.</p><p>More rattling made her spin. Gasp.</p><p>Then silence.</p><p>Demi stilled.</p><p>Was he gone?</p><p>She pulled away the phone from her ear and listened. Nothing.</p><p>She crossed the kitchen, the moonlight streaming through the blinds lighting her way.</p><p>A sound from the direction of the foyer diverted her attention in that direction, and she padded silently toward it. Was he now trying to get in the front door?</p><p>Quivering from head to toe, she gulped. Forced herself to keep it together. She had children to protect. She just prayed she'd made the right decision to let them sleep instead of grabbing them and hiding.</p><p><i>Please don't let them wake up,</i> she breathed silently. Where were the police?</p><p>"Please God," she whispered. Then wondered why she found herself praying. She didn't know if she even believed in God. But she wanted to. Wanted to believe He would help her, keep her and the children safe.</p><p>Another few seconds passed as she stared at the front door.</p><p><i>Think, Demi, think!</i></p><p>A weapon. She definitely needed a weapon. All she had to do was keep him away from the children long enough for the police to arrive.</p><p>But what could she use?</p><p>She looked at the block of knives on the kitchen counter and shuddered. The heavy crystal vase would have to do. She grabbed it, ready to hurl it at the head of whoever dared come through the front door.</p><p>Then she heard the faint sound of retreating footsteps, moving as though they were in a hurry. She rushed on silent feet to the door and pressed her ear against it.</p><p>The distant sound of sirens reached her ears.</p><p>Help was on the way.</p><p>They must have scared him off.</p><p>Relief flowed through her and she nearly dropped the vase from suddenly weak fingers.</p><p>Then realized she still held the phone in the other hand.</p><p>Demi set the vase on the table, lifted the phone to her ear and said to the 9-1-1 operator still on the line, "The police are close. I can hear their sirens."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>"I think he left. I heard him run away." Her sentences felt choppy, short. Like she was having trouble stringing coherent thoughts together.</p><p>"Don't check, just stay where you are until the police get there."</p><p>Demi didn't bother telling the woman she had no intention of opening the door.</p><p>The first police cruiser with the Fitzgerald Bay logo on the side finally pulled up to the house.</p><p>An officer opened the door and climbed out, weapon drawn, gaze darting.</p><p>And then Demi spied Charles's truck pulling up beside the officer.</p><p>Demi opened the front door and everyone froze as she stepped outside.</p><p>Charles saw his new nanny standing in the doorway and thought his heart would stop. When Owen had called to tell him Demi had dialed 9-1-1 because he had an intruder at his house, his only thought had been to get home and make sure everyone was safe. He couldn't help the terrifying thought that he'd find Demi murdered in his house. Just like Olivia, his former nanny who'd been found dead on the rocks at the base of the lighthouse that was on his property. But Demi wasn't dead. She was standing in front of him, safe and sound.</p><p>"Are you all right? The children?" He rushed to her, the limp he'd acquired while serving in Iraq not slowing him one bit. He took in every detail of her appearance. She looked scared and couldn't hide the fine tremor he could see in her hands but, at first glance, she didn't appear hurt.</p><p>Her frightened green eyes blinked wide behind her lenses. Her honey-blond hair lay in disarray as though she'd run her hands through it several times. His heartbeat didn't slow.</p><p>She nodded. "I'm fine. The children are fine, too. They never woke up."</p><p>Owen approached, followed by Charles's other brother, Deputy Chief of Police Ryan Fitzgerald. Charles introduced them and Ryan asked, "Did you get a look at him?"</p><p>Demi shook her head. "I peeked through the blinds, but never saw anyone. He was mostly near the garage door. I did hear some popping sounds, though, and the motion lights never came on."</p><p>Owen spoke to the officer next to him. "The garage is around the side of the house. Check it out, will you?"</p><p>"Sure." The man's badge read Mike Hughes.</p><p>Officer Hughes took off around the side as another patrol car pulled up. Charles groaned when he realized it was his baby sister, Keira, and her partner. Looks like the entire family had gotten the word. But Keira would be the worst. Even though she was the younger sibling, she'd want to mother him. Since Olivia's death and the suspicion that had shadowed his every move, Keira's mothering had turned to smothering.</p><p>She climbed from the vehicle, concern etched on her pretty features. "Charles?

Chesterton, Vol. 21: What I Saw in America / The Resurrection of Rome / Side Lights</h2><p>This volume contains Chesterton's commentaries and reflections on what he saw on his travels in America and Rome, plus an appendix on how America saw Chesterton. On January 10, 1921, Gilbert and Frances Chesterton began a three month tour of the United States. During their first stop in the City of New York, Chesterton examined the lights of Broadway and proclaimed: "What a glorious garden of wonders this would be to anyone who was lucky enough to be unable to read."<p>In his writing on America, Chesterton shows a remarkable ability for sympathetic appreciation of the principle traits of America. He would acquire an uncanny clear-sightedness about many things in America that it would not be an exaggeration to call clairvoyant. One greatness recognized another greatness, and one can say that Chesterton truly knew something profound about America.</p><p>Throughout the 1920's and 1930's, Chesterton's travels included Jerusalem, Ireland, North America and Rome. This volume contains his reflections on his 1921 and 1930-31 tour of North America and his 1929 trip to Rome. Readers will enjoy the great man's impressions of city skyscrapers, rural America, the politics of Washington, as well as his views of Pope Pius XI, the Eternal City, Mussolini and Fascism.</p><p>The introduction to this volume was written by Dr. Robert Royal, Vice President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington, D.C. The appendix was compiled by the late Chairman of the Northeastern Chapter of the G.K. Chesterton Society, Mr. Robert Knille.

But film and television have also explored the tension between freedom and other core values, such as order and political stability. What may look like healthy, productive, and creative freedom from one point of view may look like chaos, anarchy, and a source of destructive conflict from another. Film and television continually pose the question: Can Americans deal with their problems on their own, or must they rely on political elites to manage their lives?<br><br>In this groundbreaking work, Paul A. Cantor explores the ways in which television shows such as <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>The X-Files</i>, <i>South Park</i>, and <i>Deadwood</i> and films such as <i>The Aviator</i> and <i>Mars Attacks! </i>have portrayed both top-down and bottom-up models of order. Drawing on the works of John Locke, Adam Smith, Alexis de Tocqueville, and other proponents of freedom, Cantor contrasts the classical liberal vision of America&#x2015;particularly its emphasis on the virtues of spontaneous order&#x2015;with the Marxist understanding of the "culture industry" and the Hobbesian model of absolute state control.<br><br><i>The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture</i> concludes with a discussion of the impact of 9/11 on film and television, and the new anxieties emerging in contemporary alien-invasion narratives: the fear of a global technocracy that seeks to destroy the nuclear family, religious faith, local government, and other traditional bulwarks against the absolute state.</p><p><b>Paul A. Cantor</b> is Clifton Waller Barrett Professor of English at the University of Virginia. Among his wide-ranging and acclaimed writings on film and television, <i>Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization</i> was named one of the best nonfiction books of 2001 by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>."Cantor is undoubtedly one of the most original scholars in the field, and it will be welcome to have a collection of his essays in a single volume."&#x2015;William Irwin, Series Editor, Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture<p>"The cause of freedom has rarely had as creative a defender as Paul Cantor. To follow his thinking and writing is to be changed by them. His outlook is romantic, intellectually robust, and new. With this outlook, he finds the idea of freedom in the most inauspicious places, not only in Shakespeare (his specialization) but also in popular culture, of which he is an incredibly trenchant observer. <i>The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture</i> is as astute an examination of the idea of liberty as you will find anywhere in the history of liberal literature, and one that resonates especially in our time."&#x2015;Jeffrey Tucker, Laissez Faire Books</p><p>"Cantor demonstrates, often in new and surprising ways, what popular culture has to say about America's most significant political and social issues. Cantor's book is remarkably wide-ranging and well informed, with important insights on everything from South Park to Have Gun&#x2015;Will Travel. In this book there is something of interest for everyone who either loves or hates pop culture, or simply wonders what one should think of it. There are provocative comments on every page, firmly supported by Cantor's immense knowledge of cultural and intellectual history. The book is brilliantly written&#x2015;smart, sharp, completely free of jargon, and, frankly, a lot of fun."&#x2015;Stephen Cox, University of California, San Diego</p><p>"Cantor knows all the words to the songs in the South Park movie, speaks fluent Klingon, and has forgotten more about the X-Files than Fox Mulder ever knew. Finally, pop-culture nerds have an intellectual to call their own."&#x2015;Jonathan V. Last, senior writer <i>The Weekly Standard</i></p><p>"The incomparable Cantor has blessed the libertarian movement with a literary voice.

Reprint.</p><p>With the same curiosity, awe, and undeniable credibility, the author of the million-copy bestsellers <i>Communion </i>and <i>Transformation</i> again crosses barriers into the unknown and recounts his experiences with extraterrestrials, providing very compelling proof of their presence here on Earth.Bestselling UFO author and horror novelist Strieber (Communion, Transformation) here recounts his purported ongoing series of alien contacts over the past few years. Abducted in 1987 from his upstate New York cabin by a "visitor," Strieber is taken by UFO to Boulder, Colo., where he holds down his friend Dora Ruffner while her small daughter has her spine hammered by an insectoid alien. In 1993, a male humanoid "visitor" in a white tunic takes up residence with Strieber and his wife, imparting a sense of peace and joy. In other encounters, Strieber takes a jeep ride with a boy and ends up in an alternate universe; the "visitors" stage a journey through Eden; the author slips through the floorboards to enter the body of a human stranger. The aliens' contact with him?and with independent witnesses or contactees cited here?is cloaked in the symbolism of myth, folklore and spirituality. By this account, many who have written to Strieber divulging their UFO-related experiences report meetings with dead relatives. Without giving names or sources, Strieber also describes his involvement in a secret congressional UFO investigation. Fans will be captivated; others will be skeptical or wonder what it all means. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thompson Chain-Reference Bible NIV</h2><p>Containing Thompson&#39;s original and complete system of Bible study.</p><p></p><h2>The Mediterranean Gardener</h2><p>Hugo Latymer reveals the rich diversity of trees, shrubs, flowering plants and cacti that flourish in regions where summers are hot and dry, winters mild and wet.His knowledge and enthusiasm are communicated in descriptions of more than 300 plants, most of them readily obtainable: Chinaberry trees with fragrant lilac flowers in spring, dark green twisted carobs, beautiful red-flowered climbing lilies.

These people, and their counterparts who rest in other burial grounds in Greater Kansas City, are the individuals who gave us the Kansas City Spirit. Elmwood Cemetery: Stories of Kansas City will take you on a rich journey of discovery as the authors ... some two dozen community leaders recruited by professional photographer and Elmwood Cemetery trustee Bruce Mathews ... bring to life the stories of people who made Kansas City a thriving, diverse community, with respect for the past and an eye toward the future. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Elmwood Cemetery was founded in 1872 at 4900 Truman Road in Kansas City, Mo. Its beautiful grounds, designed by noted landscape architect George Kessler, are a repository for some 36,000 souls some famous, some infamous, some altogether unknown. Their stories trace Kansas City from its earliest days as a frontier town, through boom years when railroads first rumbled across the Missouri River, and into the 20th century, when stockyards flourished and downtown buildings muscled their way onto the skyline. Featuring the photography of Bruce Mathews. Foreword by Adele Hall. Royalty proceeds from sales of the book will be donated to the Elmwood Cemetery Society.</p><p></p><h2>Thor Visionaries - Walt Simonson, Vol. 1</h2><p>Continues the adventures of Thor, a Norse thunder god, who is torn between his original home, Asgard, and Earth, his adopted home.

At the end of the Civil War, a large study of racial difference employing the spirometer appeared to confirm the finding, which was then applied to argue that slaves were unfit for freedom. What is astonishing is that this example of racial thinking is anything but a historical relic.</p><p>In <i>Breathing Race into the Machine</i>, science studies scholar Lundy Braun traces the little-known history of the spirometer to reveal the social and scientific processes by which medical instruments have worked to naturalize racial and ethnic differences, from Victorian Britain to today. Routinely a factor in clinical diagnoses, preemployment physicals, and disability estimates, spirometers are often &#x201c;race corrected,&#x201d; typically reducing normal values for African Americans by 15 percent.</p><p>An unsettling account of the pernicious effects of racial thinking that divides people along genetic lines, <i>Breathing Race into the Machine</i> helps us understand how race enters into science and shapes medical research and practice.<br></p></p><p><p>Lundy Braun is Royce Family Professor in Teaching Excellence, professor of medical science and Africana studies, and a member of the Science and Technology Studies Program at Brown University.</p><p>"Breathing Race into the Machine brilliantly tracks the remarkable story&#x2014;lasting to the present&#x2014;of how &#x2018;correcting for race&#x2019; in measures of lung capacity became unremarkable scientific practice. This eye-opening account demonstrates that precision technologies and statistical techniques that supposedly measure biological differences accurately can mask racial myths and wreak devastating consequences for black people&#x2019;s health and legal rights. Essential reading for everyone concerned about the impact of race on science and technology."&#x2014;Dorothy Roberts, University of Pennsylvania, author of <i>Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century</i></p><p>"Lundy Braun illuminates how the development of a new machine to measure lung capacity could begin with a benign purpose to assess the impact of working conditions in the coal mines in the early 19th century, but would later &#x2018;morph&#x2019; into a justification for the putative relationship between difference and hierarchy that has remained intact for nearly two centuries. Braun documents how the social, economic and political fabric of each period is interwoven into the science of measurement&#x2014;a theme that deftly carries throughout the book, and will establish <i>Breathing Race into the Machine</i> as a landmark contribution to the social studies of science."&#x2014;Troy Duster, author of <i>Backdoor to Eugenics</i></p><p>"In <i>Breathing Race into the Machine</i>, Lundy Braun powerfully reinvigorates our understanding of how racial formation happens.

When Abigail Kirk, an odd misfit of a girl from Sydney, Australia, sews a scrap of lovely lace into the yoke of her handmade Victorian style dress, she cannot guess what it will mean for her. After she and her young friend, Natalie, observe a group of children playing a game called Beatie Bow, Abigail is transported to Victorian England in 1873, where she is acknowledged by the Bow family to be the long-awaited "stranger." Cate Milte's reading is marvelously evocative. She captures Granny's Orkney brogue and bountiful wisdom, Judah's sweet generosity, Dovey's unrelenting kindness, Mr. Bow's befuddled kindness, Gibby's incessant death-obsessed whining, and Beatie's sassy gruffness. The mystery of intricately connected events takes shape under Milte's careful reading and will make this a favorite recording of middle-grade and young adult listeners. T.B.

Neville Lancelot Goddard was born in Barbados in 1905. He came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen and whilst touring with his dance company in England he developed an interest in metaphysics, after striking up a conversation with a Scotsman who lent him a series of books on the powers of the mind. On his return he gave up the entertainment industry to devote his full attention to the study of spiritual and mystical matters. After traveling extensively throughout the United States, Neville eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television and radio, and for many years lectured regularly to capacity audiences. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. In his early lectures and books, Neville dealt solely with what he called The Law, the technique of creating one&#39;s physical reality through imagining. It is this portion of his expression that most closely accords with the teachings of the New Thought movement. In 1959 he began to experience what he called The Promise. In the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s Neville gave more emphasis to The Promise than to The Law. One could use imaginal power to change one&#39;s circumstances, he said, but it would be temporary, &#34;...and will vanish like smoke.&#34; He went on to explain that The Promise superseded The Law, claiming &#34;Oh, you can use it [The Law] to make a fortune, to become known in the world, all these things are done, but, your true purpose here is to fulfill Scripture.&#34; After subordinating The Law to The Promise, he became as eager to hear accounts by those who had experienced The Promise, and sharing such accounts, as he had earlier of those with The Law.The Power of Awareness attempts to demonstrate how to use our mind to realize our wishes. As such, it is an important part of the larger New Though Movement, in which Neville holds a prominent place.</p><p><b>Neville Goddard</b> is well known as one of the most influential teachers and writers of metaphysical work. Nevill was born on 19 February 1905 in Barbados. He was the fourth child in a family of nine boys and one girl. In 1922, Nevill came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen. During his entertaining tour in England as a vaudeville dancer and stage actor, he developed a great interest in metaphysics. Hence, he gave up his entertainment job and became devoted fully to the study of metaphysics and spiritual matters.

That brilliant moment is the cornerstone of the new masterful book by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough, who brings his deft touch with language and his eye for humanizing details to the unusually close relationship between a pair of brothers from Dayton, Ohio, who changed aviation history. Bicycle shop owners by day, Wilbur and Orville taught themselves flight theory through correspondence with the Smithsonian and other experts. But the brothers soon realized that theory was no match for practical testing, and they repeatedly risked life and limb in pursuit of their goal&#x2014;including when Orville fractured a leg and four ribs in a 75-foot plunge to the ground. McCullough&#x2019;s narration of ventures such as this&#x2014;their famous first flight at Kitty Hawk; the flight in Le Mans, France that propelled the brothers to international fame; the protracted patent battles back at home; and the early death of elder brother Wilbur&#x2014;will immerse readers in the lives of the Wright family. Like other great biographies before it, <em>The Wright Brothers</em> tells the story about the individuals behind the great moments in history, while never sacrificing beauty in language and reverence in tone. <em>&#x2013; Manfred Collado</em></p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for Truman and John Adams, and twice received the National Book Award, for The Path Between the Seas and Mornings on Horseback. His other acclaimed books are 1776, Brave Companions, The Johnstown Flood, The Great Bridge, and The Greater Journey.

Billy Bryan has seen his share. A former minor-league catcher for the Washington Senators, Bryan is now a retired high school teacher, widowed with a grown daughter, and "coming to the end of many things." Then a long-forgotten scrapbook stirs memories of a distant past--and beckons him on a reluctant journey to relive his own extraordinary role in history. . . .<br><br>In 1947, Bryan is playing winter ball in Cuba, immersing himself in the decadent nightlife of Havana, and dreaming of someday "making it" to the majors. But his future on the diamond is as uncertain as Cuba itself, a country where rumblings of revolution hang in the air like a high fly ball to left. Then one fateful night Bryan witnesses a young student radical named Fidel hurl pitch after amazing pitch. So begins Billy's tug-of-war with destiny--to score a victory for the game he worships, win the heart of the woman he loves, or make his mark in a world racing toward revolution. . . .</p><p>Everybody has a past; some are more intriguing than others. When retired schoolteacher Billy Bryan's daughter begins cleaning his house a few days after his wife's death, she finds in the forgotten pages of his dusty scrapbook part of a past she's never known. The memories they invoke send the grieving Billy--"I think God has fed me a breaking ball to keep me off balance"--and his daughter on a remarkable journey back to his youth, where, as a major-league hopeful, he played winter baseball in Cuba half a century ago. It was there that his life changed when he crossed paths with a young student radical with a dynamite curve and a revolutionary's fire named Fidel Castro. <p> Wendel's lustrous prose and imaginative storytelling paint a vivid portrait of a life not just lived, but inhaled against a backdrop of a nation mad for baseball and not far from political and social upheaval. Having caught Castro's extraordinarily feathery curveball in an exhibition, Billy befriends the future leader, falling under his charismatic spell and enormous dreams for a new nation. Billy also falls, deeply, for a beautiful Cuban photographer who is so caught by Castro's visions that destiny deems the strands of their lives can never twine. "Castro was a hurricane unto himself," Billy recalls. "When I first met him, that side of him seemed refreshing, almost funny in a strange way." But the closer he got to Cuba's future leader, the more that would change. Just how much--and at what personal cost--is the secret that Billy, now an old man on a return trip to his past, must confront as if it were a fastball down the heart of his life, and make his peace with it at last. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Tim Wendel is an award-winning writer whose articles and columns have appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.

However, it is much more than that as well. It opens the doors to the authentic understanding of ancient Celtic cosmology and psychology in ways that have never been done before. This, as much as the divinatory material, opens the reader to vistas as yet uncharted in the fields of Celtic studies. The book contains a complete system of oghamic divination, the lore of each of the 20 ogham characters, a Celtic psychology and Celtic cosmology as well as a complete suggested curriculum for training in Celtic spirituality based on the ogham system. One of the most important new features of this edition is the information demonstrating the fact that the ogham system was not originally a &#34;tree alphabet.&#34; This book is a thorough and substantial rewriting of a book by Edred Thorsson by the same name published more than a decade ago. This new edition takes into account important new findings in the realm of ogham studies and must be read and studied by all those who first read the older edition in order that a deeper and more authentic understanding can be reached.</p><p></p><h2>Strong through the Storm: How to Be a Christian in the World Today</h2><p><p>The Church today is in the middle of a powerful storm, the intensity of which is likely to increase in the future. Many Christians are bewildered and concerned by what they see&#x2014;a culture that&#x2019;s become increasingly hostile to biblical Christianity and a church whose vital signs are quickly waning.</p><p>In <em>Strong through the Storm</em>, pastor and bestselling author Jim Cymbala speaks to every Christian who is concerned about the challenges the church is facing in America today. Using powerful stories of people who have been transformed by Christ, Cymbala offers hope, helping Christians to understand that a life surrendered to Christ will not be easily defeated, even in the midst of growing hostility toward Christians. No matter how much spiritual darkness encompasses the world, the light of the gospel cannot be suppressed.</p><p>Some churches are coming at the storm with harsh legalism, but Cymbala explains that the message needs to be grace. We need to understand the spiritual battle we are in and use the right weapons against it, says Cymbala. We are not struggling against the leaders of this world or the people in the battle, we are struggling against our spiritual enemy, and we need to fight with the Word of God, prayer, and the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We don&#x2019;t need more church growth programs to turn the church around. What&#x2019;s needed is a transformation so that the gospel is preached, the Holy Spirit is allowed to lead, and lives are changed.</p></p><p><p>Jim Cymbala has been the pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle for more than thirty-five years.

Jockers' <i>The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel </i>is a big idea book that explains their text-mining research through a groundbreaking look at the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list. It explores the relationship between creativity and analytics, picking bestsellers via algorithm with a high degree of accuracy. We know that technology has transformed the worlds of finance, medicine, and sports; now it's making its mark on books.</p><p>Ask most people about massive success in the world of fiction, and you&#x2019;ll typically hear that it&#x2019;s a game of hazy crystal balls. The sales figures of E. L. James or Dan Brown seem to be freakish&#x2015;random occurrences in an unknowable market. But what if there were an algorithm that could reveal a secret DNA of bestsellers, regardless of their genre? What if it knew, just from analyzing the words alone, not just why genre writers like John Grisham and Danielle Steel belong on the lists, but also that authors such as Junot Diaz, Jodi Picoult, and Donna Tartt had telltale signs of success all over their pages? </p><p>The algorithm exists; the code has been cracked; and the results bring fresh new insights into how fiction works and why we read. <i>The Bestseller Code</i> offers a new theory for why <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> sold so well. It sheds light on the current craze for dark heroines. It reveals which themes tend to sell best. And all with fascinating supporting data taken from a five-year study of twenty thousand novels. Then there is the hunt for "the one"&#x2015;the paradigmatic example of bestselling writing according to a computer's analysis of thousands of points of data. The result is surprising, a bit ironic, and delightfully unorthodox.</p><p>At heart, <i>The Bestseller Code</i> is a celebration of books for readers and writers&#x2015;a compelling investigation into how successful writing works, and a fresh take on our intellectual and emotional response to stories.</p></p><p><p>JODIE ARCHER bought and edited books for Penguin UK before decamping for the doctoral program in English at Stanford University.

He could not walk far from the house for want of strength; but he loved to sit with Aunt Abby in her quiet room, talking of unseen glories, and heart-experiences, while planning for the spiritual benefit of those around them. In these confidential interviews, Frado was never omitted. They would discuss the prevalent opinion of the public, that people of color are really inferior; incapable of cultivation and refinement. They would glance at the qualities of Nig, which promised so much if rightly directed. &#34;I wish you would take her, James, when you are well, home with YOU,&#34; said Aunt Abby, in one of these seasons. &#34;Just what I am longing to do, Aunt Abby. Susan is just of my mind, and we intend to take her; I have been wishing to do so for years.&#34; &#34;She seems much affected by what she hears at the evening meetings, and asks me many questions on serious things; seems to love to read the Bible; I feel hopes of her.&#34; &#34;I hope she IS thoughtful; no one has a kinder heart, one capable of loving more devotedly. But to think how prejudiced the world are towards her people; that she must be reared in such ignorance as to drown all the finer feelings. When I think of what she might be, of what she will be, I feel like grasping time till opinions change, and thousands like her rise into a noble freedom. I have seen Frado&#39;s grief, because she is black, amount to agony. It makes me sick to recall these scenes.

Suddenly he was approached by two of his pupils with an urgent question: Would his new indications for treating soil and vegetables be sufficient to provide, &#39;...nutrition appropriate to our times and in accordance with the spirit?&#39; Steiner&#39;s frank response was somewhat surprising: &#39;It will not be sufficient even in the most favourable circumstances. What should be done is to cultivate the Dioscorea batatas in Europe so that it can take over from the potato as the staple diet.&#39; In the many decades since that conversation, various attempts have been made to cultivate Dioscorea batatas - the &#39;light root&#39; - in Europe, initially by Steiner&#39;s close colleague Guenther Wachsmuth. More recently, biodynamic farmer Ralf Roessner began to research the plant and its background, but soon discovered problems with the specimens available in Europe.Unsatisfied with the standard of the plants, in 2002 he travelled to the original growing areas of Dioscorea batatas in China, where he was able to form a comprehensive picture of the best planting methods and conditions. &#39;The nodules which I found and brought back with me&#39;, he writes, &#39;showed similar light ether characteristics to the original plants of Wachsmuth&#39;s&#39;. Having successfully cultivated and marketed this light root, Roessner presents some carefully assembled introductory materials based on his experiences and those of a colleague. This small book, illustrated with colour images, is intended for people who wish to discover more about the plant&#39;s being and spiritual mission as a &#39;helper of progress&#39;. Roessner explains how the light root stores &#39;light ether&#39; in a unique manner, making it not only a valuable food, but also a &#39;carrier of the spirit&#39;. This light root could even &#39;...decisively influence the development of humanity and the earth&#39;. Aside from studying esoteric aspects, he gives answers to frequently-asked practical questions about the plant and its cultivation.</p><p>RALF ROESSNER is a passionate bee keeper and a biodynamic farmer, cultivating and processing the &#39;light root&#39; (Dioscorea batatas), which his company IMTON GmbH develops and markets. In addition, Ralph has been working in the field of water research for 20 years. As an ex-Waldorf school teacher he is interested in all new developments in education, and as a father of two grown up children he aims to be in touch with the pulse of the times. All the above informs his quest for healthy nutrition for the future through meditative as well as experimental research into subtle matter.&#39;This plant is the only one which is in a position to store light ether; this will be indispensable for people in future.&#39; - Rudolf Steiner</p><h2>Advanced Practice Nursing, 3Rd Edn</h2><p>ISBN - 9789384323103 - Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Buffalo Memories: Gone But not Forgotten</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

A woman who lives by scavenging corpses in the Japanese suicide forest is haunted by her dead lover. A man searches for the memory that will overwrite his childhood abuse. Helios is left at the altar. The world is made quiet by a series of apocalypses. <br> <br>From the riveting emotion and politics of 'The Lady Who Plucked Red Flowers beneath the Queen's Window' (Nebula winner) to the melancholy family saga of 'Eros, Philia, Agape' (Hugo and Theodore Sturgeon finalist), Rachel Swirsky's critically acclaimed stories have quickly made her one of the field's rising stars. Her work is, by turns, clever and engaging, unflinching and quietly devastating--often in the space of the same story. <br> <br>How the World Became Quiet: Myths of the Past, Present, and Future collects the body of Swirsky's short fiction to date for the first time. While these stories envision pasts, presents, and futures that never existed, they offer revealing examinations of humanity that readers will find undeniably true.</p><p>Starred Review. Swirsky&#39;s career, which began in 2006, so far includes the publication of over 50 short stories and poems, attracting nominations for most of speculative fiction&#39;s major awards. The 18 stories in this fine collection show Swirsky&#39;s range in both fantasy and SF: The Lady Who Plucked Red Flowers Beneath the Queen&#39;s Window is the tale of a conniving revenant; the title story is an almost Stapledonian exploration of deep time and transformation; The Monster&#39;s Million Faces examines the utility of vengeance; and Eros, Philia, Agape considers the problems of autonomic created beings in revolutionary ways. Swirsky&#39;s crisp prose and insightful vision draw the reader in, and her work will amply reward both casual reading and close attention.

With armored bodies, an armored radiator shutter and bulletproof glass windscreen, the half-track offered crew protection and endurance under fire, while its speed - up to 45 mph - added a new dimension to infantry mobility. After testing and acceptance, the White design was standardized and during the war built by White, Autocar and Diamond T as the M3 half-track. Nearly 41,000 would be produced during the war, along with an additional 13,500 units of the smaller M2. Variants included the M13, M15 and M16 gun motor carriage, the M21 mortar carrier, and the T19 and T30 Howitzer motor carriages. Created in 1944, this TM 9-710 technical manual includes many photos and over 350 pages of text that reveal a great deal about the weapon&#39;s design and capabilities. Intended as a manual for those charged with operation and maintenance, this manual shows many aspects of its engine, cooling, power train and other systems. Originally labeled restricted, this manual was declassified long ago and is here reprinted in book form. Care has been taken to preserve the integrity of the text.</p><p></p><h2>Potluck</h2><p>Alpha and Betty have a potluck and all their friends (Acton to Zelda) bring appropriate alphabetical food (asparagus soup to zucchini casserole).</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- Alpha and Betty have a potluck party for 31, and call up their friends. The children, in alphabetical order, bring a dish to match the initial letter of their name. Shelby sometimes makes the entire phrase alliterative, as in "Ben brought bagels," and occasionally throws in inconsistent words ("mounds and mounds of mashed potatoes" and "Victor ventured vegetarian stew"). The children represented are racially and ethnically diverse, and are frequently depicted in festive, colorful costumes. The bright watercolor cartoons range from serviceable to quite charming, depending on how vividly the individual child's personality is communicated. Because of its free approach with its own formula, and the lack of initial letters on the pages, this is not so much an ABC teaching tool as a cheerful book to enjoy. The pictures are large enough to use with a group and, although the text is not distinguished, the story will reinforce the concepts both of the alphabet, and of the variety of people in our world. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Pub .

He&#39;s already confessed to the murder of Tracy Kostakos, the club&#39;s rising star. But two years after the crime, Tracy&#39;s body is still missing and Bobby&#39;s confession is full of holes. All Souls Legal Cooperative&#39;s final appeal sends San Francisco&#39;s #1 P.I. Sharon McCone behind the footlights into the super-charged arena of anxious club owners and aspiring young hopefuls...into the fractured world of Tracy&#39;s privileged family and the mind of a young comedienne who was not the good little girl they thought they knew...into a labyrinth of death and deception where someone will kill to laugh last and get away with murder.</p><p>Marcia Muller is the author of more than thirty&#x2013;five novels, including the critically&#x2013;acclaimed Sharon McCone series. She's been recognized with the 2005 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America, the Private Eye Writers of America Lifetime Achievement Award, a Ridley Award, an American Mystery Award, and the Anthony Award.With this extraordinarily complex, gripping novel, Muller surpasses the previous stories of Sharon McCone, San Francisco-based private eye. Sharon relates details in the case that takes her to meet Bobby Fisher in San Quentin where he's doomed to the gas chamber for the murder of Tracy Kostakos, a popular comic. Hoping to save Bobby, the investigator questions the owners of the Club Comedie, Jay Larkey and his partner, Rob Soriano, Soriano's wife and everyone else who had known Tracy, including her parents, fiance and roommate. The consensus is that the witty monologuist paradoxically lacked a sense of humor but had created hilarious routines by cruelly parodying people close to her. Digging deeper into the said already, ok? entertainer's past, Sharon unearths evidence that she may pay for with her own life. Evoking the atmosphere of San Francisco's special places, Muller makes one feel particularly the "shape of dread" on death row and provokes thought on the finality of capital punishment. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Allen &amp; Mike's Really Cool Telemark Tips</h2><p>Over 100 tips for beginners and experts looking to improve their telemark skiing.

She lives in a magic tower that obeys her every wish; she reads wonderful books starring herself as the heroine; her hair is the longest, most glorious thing in the world. And she knows this because Witch tells her so-- her beloved Witch, who protects her from evil princes, the dangerous ground under the tower, even unhappy thoughts. Rapunzel can't imagine any other life.<br>Then a thief named Jack climbs into her room to steal one of her enchanted roses. He's the first person Rapunzel's ever met who isn't completely charmed by her (well, the first person she's met at all, really), and he is infuriating-- especially when he hints that Witch isn't telling her the whole truth. Driven by anger at Jack and her own nameless fears, Rapunzel descends to the ground for the first time, and finds a world filled with more peril than Witch promised...and more beauty, wonder, and adventure than she could have dreamed.</p><p><b>You know the tower, the hair, and the witch.<br>But in the land of Tyme, that's just the start of the story....</b><br><br>Rapunzel has never visited a fairy court, or won a jacks tournament, or slept under the stars. She hasn't outwitted a Stalking beast, or made a friend, or adopted a very opinionated frog. She knows only her enchanted tower, which obeys her every command, and her wonderful Witch, who guards her against evil princes far below. Beautiful, beloved, and innocent, Rapunzel can't imagine a happier life.<br><br>But when a thief named Jack climbs into her tower, that happy life breaks open forever. Because Rapunzel learns then that Witch is in terrible danger -- and to keep her safe, she must leave her tower and journey with Jack on a quest far across Tyme. There she finds a world filled with even more peril than Witch promised... and even more magic, wonder, and excitement than she ever dreamed.<br><br>Much more than just a retelling of the story of Rapunzel, <i>Grounded</i> is a marvelous adventure, a moving family drama, and a captivating introduction to the world of Tyme -- with many tales to come.Megan Morrison is a middle-school drama teacher and a writer.

Nine years later, Freud completely reversed his position, insisting that these sexual memories were actually fantasies that never happened. Why did Freud retract the seduction theory? And why has the psychoanalytic community gone to such lengths to conceal that retraction? In this landmark book, drawing on his unique access to formerly sealed and hidden papers, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson dares to uncover the truth about this critical turning point in Freud&#x2019;s career and its enduring impact on the theory and practice of psychoanalysis. <br><br><i>The Assault on Truth</i> reveals a reality that neither Freud nor his followers could bear to face. Bracing in its honesty, gripping its revelations, this is the book that prompted Masson&#x2019;s break with the psychoanalytic community&#x2013;and launched his subsequent brilliant career as an independent thinker and writer.</p><p>&#x201c;A Watergate of the psyche.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>With a new introduction by the author<br><b>&#x201c;A LAVISHLY DOCUMENTED, CAREFULLY REASONED WORK, WRITTEN IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD, REASONABLE STYLE.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Nation</i></b><br><b>&#x201c;INTRIGUING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING . . .

Reprint.</p><p>Sister Joan, that robust, cheerful English nun, makes her sixth appealing appearance (following A Vow of Penance). Assisted by unbelieving Det. Sgt. Alan Mill, Sister Joan, 38, fights the evil that has entered the Cornwell convent of the dedicated Daughters of Compassion along with two postulants-the latter a rarity these days. Joan sees a batlike shadow on the convent walls the night the would-be nuns arrive, and finds expensive hothouse roses left in odd places. One of the candidates is strange, frightened Magdalen Cole of London, of whom Joan harbors an un-nunlike distrust-especially after the nun who changed beds with Magdalen is murdered. The other candidate is sunny, eager Bernadette Fawkes of Yorkshire. Arriving in the area at the same time is a large group of New Age travelers, whom the generous Joan supposes to be "rather like" Jesus and his disciples "journeying about the Holy Land." Because the mystery here is fairly straightforward, readers will find most satisfaction in Black's rendering of convent life and in the charms of Sister Joan's earthy good sense. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA?Sister Joan of the Order of Daughters of Compassion returns to sleuthing for the sixth time. Once again her community in Cornwall is beset by odd behavior and strange happenings. The quiet atmosphere begins to evaporate as two prospective candidates for the convent life arrive on the scene. Over several nights as she sees to convent security, Sister Joan finds unlocked doors, freshly cut blood-red roses near the altar, and a knife in the chapel. Soon a tragic death occurs and she must decide how much she should reveal to her superior, Mother Dorothy, as well as to her friend Detective Sgt. Mill. Once again Black has taken the unusual aspects of convent life and added a gutsy protagonist with strong religious and moral values. She balances them with an intriguing plot, a flock of possible villains, and a tough but supportive police presence that respects Sister Joan's allegiance to an authority even higher than the law.

Yet the sudden impulse to write a story about her mother, Katherine Morrissey, leads to a shot at literary success. The piece recounts an eerie Irish fairy tale her mother used to tell her at bedtime&#x2014;and nestled inside it is the sad story of her death. It captures the attention of her mother&#x2019;s former literary agent, who is convinced that Katherine wrote one final manuscript before her strange, untimely end in a fire thirty years ago. So Iris goes back to the remote Hotel Equinox in the Catskills, the place where she grew up, to write her mother&#x2019;s biography and search for the missing manuscript&#x2014;and there she unravels a haunting mystery, one that holds more secrets than she ever expected. . . .</p><p>Carol Goodman's admirable second novel, <i>The Seduction of Water</i>, has much in common with her bestselling debut, <i>The Lake of Dead Languages</i>. Both feature heroines who are at crossroads in their lives and who choose to move backward and inward. In the first novel, the main character returns to teach at the woodsy private school where she had been a scholarship student, triggering the horrible repetition of the violence that had marred her senior year. In <i>The Seduction of Water</i>, the heroine returns to the woodsy hotel in the Catskills where her parents had worked, in the hope of uncovering her dead mother's secrets. Somehow, the book doesn't feel like a reiteration of the earlier novel, perhaps because the tone throughout is lighter and more sure. <p> Iris Greenfeder is a 36-year-old barely published New York writer and teacher whose long-term boyfriend, an artist, sees her schedule as strict and therefore will not spend the night, because he likes to get up and paint first thing every morning. When one of Iris's stories about her mother is picked up by a small literary journal with a well-connected editor, things start to happen for her. She becomes convinced that a summer out of the city, working as manager of the old hotel, will give her the perfect setting in which to pen a memoir of her writer mother, as well as an opportunity to look for the rumored manuscript of her mother's final book. But there are those who are just as determined to keep the dead woman's secrets in the grave. Only mildly suspenseful, and relying too much on coincidence, <i>The Seduction of Water</i> isn't the page-turner that Goodman's debut was, but patient readers may find it a richer and more satisfying novel overall. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>&#x201c;An atmospheric thriller, but a smart one with a racing story line.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York</i> magazine&#x201c;GOTHIC MYSTERY . . . <i>Seduction</i> enchants with its fairy-tale motif and sensuous atmospherics.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People</i> (Page-turner of the week)&#x201c;TRULY A SEDUCTIVE READING EXPERIENCE . . .

Most of this material was gathered directly from Indian narrators by Charles G. Leland (1824-1903), a brilliant and gifted Philadelphia-born journalist, essayist, and folklorist.<br>In compiling the work, Leland noted interesting affinities between the myths of the Northeastern tribes and those of the Eskimos, and striking similarities between the myths of the Algonquins and the <i>Eddas</i>, sagas and popular tales of Scandinavia. For example, may of the stories in this book deal with Glooskap, a divinity with strong resemblances to such Norse gods as Thor and Odin. We learn how Glooskap made man from an ash tree, named the animals, gave gifts to men, went to England and France and made America known to the Europeans, and performed many other curious deeds. Here too are the merry tales of Lox, the Mischief-maker, who bears a strong resemblance to Loki of Scandinavian mythology.

She was elected as a Democrat to Congress at 31 and was a star and a role model for many young women at the 1974 Watergate hearings; but she lost badly in Senate races in 1980 and 1992, and then failed to win re-election as New York City Comptroller in 1994. In those losing battles, Holtzman confronted a great deal of personal vilification. &#34;In the comptroller&#39;s race I was often called a &#39;witch&#39;,&#34; she writes. Here Holtzman gives her side of the story of her political career.In a compelling, dramatic account of a remarkable career, Holtzman recreates her two decades in public office, from 1973, when she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress (D-N.Y.), to 1993, when she lost her bid for reelection as New York City comptroller. Her investigative work as a member of the House Judiciary Committee helped thwart Nixon's cover-up of Watergate. Her efforts to bring Nazi war criminals hiding in the U.S. to justice led to the creation of a federal Nazi-fighting unit that expelled hundreds of Nazis from the country. She writes movingly of her tumultuous years as Brooklyn District Attorney (1981-1989), prosecuting cases of rape, battering, incest, child abuse and other crimes. As NYC comptroller, her campaigns to block municipal incinerators and to fight corruption, wasteful spending and bureaucracy put her in direct confrontation with the Mafia, the pollution lobby and a contracting system mired in vested interests. She calls for a "peace dividend," a post-Cold War redirection of military spending to schools, affordable housing and social services. Though this memoir at times veers toward self-promotion, Holtzman, a liberal and activist, emerges as a woman of integrity who lives by her principles. Her coauthor Cooper wrote Mockery of Justice: The True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case.

Author of of many books, farmer, soldier, prisoner of war, political adviser to British heads of state, educator, humanitarian, philosopher, explorer, and conservationist are titles that barely indicate the depth and breadth of this rare individual. Born in 1906 in the interior of southern Africa, he lived among the people who created the first blueprint for life on earth, becoming the principal chronicler of the Stone Age Kalahari Bushmen. He was also one of C.G. Jung's closest friends for sixteen years. Van der Post dedicated his life to teaching the meaning and value of indigenous cultures in the modern world, a world he felt is in danger of losing its spiritual identity to technology, prejudice, empty values, and a lack of understanding of the interconnectedness of all life on earth. Awarded a knighthood (the C.B.E.) in 1981, Sir Laurens died after his 90th birthday, in December, 1996. <br><br>He has written the following books:<br>A Far Off Place<br>The Heart of the Hunter&#x200e;<br>A Story Like the Wind<br></p><h2>Disagreement: Politics and Philosophy</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Is there any such thing as political philosophy?&#x201d; So begins this provocative book by one of the foremost figures in Continental thought. Here, Jacques Ranci�re brings a new and highly useful set of terms to the vexed debate about political effectiveness and &#x201c;the end of politics.&#x201d;</p><p>What precisely is at stake in the relationship between &#x201c;philosophy&#x201d; and the adjective &#x201c;political&#x201d;? In<i>&nbsp;Disagreement</i>, Ranci�re explores the apparent contradiction between these terms and reveals the uneasy meaning of their union in the phrase &#x201c;political philosophy&#x201d;&#x2014;a juncture related to age-old attempts in philosophy to answer Plato&#x2019;s devaluing of politics as a &#x201c;democratic egalitarian&#x201d; process.</p><p>According to Ranci�re, the phrase also expresses the paradox of politics itself: the absence of a proper foundation. Politics, he argues, begins when the &#x201c;demos&#x201d; (the &#x201c;excessive&#x201d; or unrepresented part of society) seeks to disrupt the order of domination and distribution of goods &#x201c;naturalized&#x201d; by police and legal institutions. In addition, the notion of &#x201c;equality&#x201d; operates as a game of contestation that constantly substitutes litigation for political action and community. This game, Ranci�re maintains, operates by a primary logic of &#x201c;misunderstanding.&#x201d; In turn, political philosophy has always tried to substitute the &#x201c;politics of truth&#x201d; for the politics of appearances.</p><p><i>Disagreement</i>&nbsp;investigates the various transformations of this regime of &#x201c;truth&#x201d; and their effects on practical politics. Ranci�re then distinguishes what we mean by &#x201c;democracy&#x201d; from the practices of a consensual system in order to unravel the ramifications of the fashionable phrase &#x201c;the end of politics.&#x201d; His conclusions will be of interest to readers concerned with political questions from the broadest to the most specific and local.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Other People&#39;s Property: A Shadow History of Hip-Hop in White America</h2><p><p>Over the last quarter-century hip-hop has grown from an esoteric form of African-American expression to become the dominant form of American popular culture. Today, Snoop Dogg shills for Chrysler and white kids wear Fubu, the black-owned label whose name stands for "For Us, By Us." This is not the first time that black music has been appreciated, adopted, and adapted by white audiences&#x2015;think jazz, blues, and rock&#x2015;but Jason Tanz, a white boy who grew up in the suburban Northwest, says that hip-hop's journey through white America provides a unique window to examine the racial dissonance that has become a fact of our national life. In such culture-sharing Tanz sees white Americans struggling with their identity, and wrestling (often unsuccessfully) with the legacy of race. </p><p>To support his anecdotally driven history of hip-hop's cross-over to white America, Tanz conducts dozens of interviews with fans, artists, producers, and promoters, including some of hip-hop's most legendary figures&#x2015;such as Public Enemy's Chuck D; white rapper MC Serch; and former <i>Yo! MTV Raps</i> host Fab 5 Freddy. He travels across the country, visiting "nerdcore" rappers in Seattle, who rhyme about Star Wars conventions; a group of would-be gangstas in a suburb so insulated it's called "the bubble"; a break-dancing class at the upper-crusty New Canaan Tap Academy; and many more. Drawing on the author's personal experience as a white fan as well as his in-depth knowledge of hip-hop's history, <i>Other People's Property</i> provides a hard-edged, thought-provoking, and humorous snapshot of the particularly American intersection of race, commerce, culture, and identity.</p></p><p><p><b>Jason Tanz</b> is a senior editor at <i>Fortune Small Business</i>. His work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, <i>Spin</i>, and <i>Time Out New York</i>, among other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>Suburban white kids' increasingly ubiquitous fascination with hip-hop culture is the subject of this thoughtful and often insightful work of long-form journalism. Tanz, a young white man himself and an editor at <i>Fortune Small Business</i>, is an apt chronicler of the racial and cultural obstacles that stand between the producers and consumers of rap. He has an obvious passion for the music at hand, and he demonstrates his connoisseurship through brilliant evocations of the power of the band N.W.A. and the often painful history of white rappers. Tanz is most successful when he lets himself get tangled up in the complicated tendons of mass culture: his chapter about hip-hop marketing and commercialization displays a keen understanding of the advertising forces at work without ever devolving into simplistic damnation. Other aspects of the book are less satisfying, most notably the framing devices for each chapter in which Tanz chooses seemingly arbitrary instances of white appropriations of hip-hop culture&#x2014;such as a hipster dance party in Williamsburg&#x2014;to illustrate larger points. Nevertheless, Tanz solidly displays his strong grasp of the broad cultural significance of the rise of hip-hop. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Divided into flats years before, there is a brick wall behind a door where once there was a corridor and one day it is corridor again, down which the intrepid Coraline wanders. And so a nightmare-ish mystery begins that takes Coraline into the arms of counterfeit parents and a life that isn&#39;t quite right. Can Coraline get out? Can she find her real parents? Will life ever be the same again? &#34;I think this book will nudge &#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34; out of its niche at last. It is the most splendidly original, weird, and frightening book I have read, and yet full of things children will love.&#34; - Diana Wynne Jones. &#34;This book will send a shiver down your spine, out through your shoes and into a taxi to the airport. It has the delicate horror of the finest fairy tales, and it is a masterpiece. And you will never think about buttons in quite the same way again.&#34; - Terry Pratchett.</p><p>Despite being mostly known for his fantastical graphic novels and adult fiction, Neil Gaiman's first book for children is everything that you would expect from such a massive imagination as his. It's special and wonderful and very weird indeed. Described by some as the new <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>Coraline</i> is actually more bizarre than that, much more frightening and its modest length definitely adds to the book's undiluted potency. <p> Shortly after moving into an old house with strange tenants above and below, Coraline discovers a big, carved, brown wooden door at the far corner of the drawing room. And it is locked. Curiosity runs riot in Coraline's mind and she unlocks the door to see what lies behind it. Disappointingly, it opens onto a brick wall. Days later, after exploring the rest of the house and garden, Coraline returns to the same mysterious door and opens it again. This time, however, there is a dark hallway in front of her. Stepping inside, the place beyond has an eerie familiarity about it. The carpet and wallpaper are the same as in her flat. The picture hanging on the wall is the same. Almost. Strangest of all, her mum and dad are there too. Only they have buttons for eyes and seem more possessive than normal. It's a twisted version of her world that is familiar, and yet sinister. And matters get even more surreal for Coraline when her "other" parents seem reluctant to let her leave.</p><p> Her attempted escape from this nightmare alternative reality sees Coraline experience a chilling series of ever more bizarre encounters. Some are plainly odd, others disturbingly spooky and together they combine to form an immensely readable story. It's like all the best bits of the <i>Goosebumps</i> books condensed into 160 pages.

She still sings the same song when her baby has turned into a fractious 2-year-old, a slovenly 9-year-old, and then a raucous teen. So far so ordinary--but this is one persistent lady. When her son grows up and leaves home, she takes to driving across town with a ladder on the car roof, climbing through her grown son's window, and rocking the sleeping man in the same way. Then, inevitably, the day comes when she's too old and sick to hold him, and the roles are at last reversed. Each stage is illustrated by one of Sheila McGraw's comic and yet poignant pastels.

Hank Greenberg was a Hall of Famer in every way.&#34; Peter V. Ueberroth. This book was edited with an introduction by Ira Berkow.</p><p>Hank Greenberg (1911-1986) led the Detroit Tigers to four pennants and two World Series titles, and in 1938 came within two home runs of Babe Ruth's 60-home-run record. Ira Berkow, who provided textual background for Greenberg's autobiography, is a former Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>New York Times</i> sports columnist and author of many books, including <i>Red: A Biography of Red Smith</i> and <i>Full Swing: Hits, Runs and Errors in a Writer's Life</i>.For many, baseball's charm thrives on the oral tradition of grandfathers, with grandsons on their laps, passing down, in proper reverential tones, the legacy of players and memories. The late Greenberg captures that spirit here, blending the right combination of humility and fact to recount a career in which this first Jewish baseball star was considered not only the greatest and most powerful right-handed hitter in the major leagues but a successful baseball general manager and investment broker as well. He seems comfortable with the life he led, not disturbed by the reactions his being a Jew brought out in his contemporaries on the field and in the stands and explaining how he turned anti-Semitic incidents into positive motivational responses on his part rather than striking back in other ways. Because he died before the book was finished, Berkow, sportswriter for the New York Times , has filled gaps with interviews with Greenberg's family and contemporaries. Their memories lack the balance the baseball star's own text possesses and the prose becomes syrupy and muddling. Luckily these added reminiscences occupy little space. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Western Paintings of Frank C.

The Academy's first client employs Lady Charlotte Dalrumple to teach her untrained grandchildren the rules of proper English society. It isn't until Charlotte meets the children that she realizes she's also been hired to re-train their father, who left England at 15 for a life of adventure among the Bedouins of the Far East.

His second attempt also failed: a deep slash across his throat left a large pool of blood at the entrance to his studio, but he was still able to reach his easel on the opposite side of the room. Only his third attempt, another cut to the throat which sprayed blood across his unfinished canvas, was successful. He died face-down before the bespattered "Alfred and the First British Jury," his final bid "to improve the taste of the English people" through the High Art of historical painting. Such intensity, struggle and near-comic inability to succeed encapsulate Haydon's career. Thirty years before his death his huge, iconic paintings had made him the toast of early 19th-century London, drawing paying crowds to the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly for months and leading to nationwide tours. However, his attempt to repeat such success three months before his death was to destroy him: barely a soul turned up, leaving the desperate painter alone, humiliated, and facing financial ruin. In "A Genius for Failure" Paul O'Keeffe makes clear that the real tragedy of Haydon lay in the extent to which his failures were unwittingly engineered by his own actions - his refusal to resort to the painting of fashionable portraits, for example, and his self-destructively acrimonious relationship with the RA. The company he kept - Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington, among many others - and the momentous events he lived through - The Battle of Waterloo, the Coronation of George IV, and the passing of the first Parliamentary Reform Bill - make "A Genius for Failure" not only the definitive biography of this fascinating and tragic painter, but a stirring portrayal of an age.</p><p><b>Paul O'Keeffe</b> is a freelance lecturer and writer&nbsp;who won critical acclaim with his 2000 study of Lewis, <i>Some Sort of Genius</i>.&#34;O&#39;Keeffe has done an exhilarating job&#34; -- Emma Crichton-Miller * Evening Standard * &#34;Haydon&#39;s story is essentially tragic but it has many elements of comedy, even high farce, and Paul O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s biography brings the comedy to the fore with an enviable lightness of touch&#34; -- Peter Burton * Daily Express * &#34;Haydon&#39;s story is one of the great cautionary tales in art history, and it still has the power to shock, even after 150 years: there is barely a page in Paul O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s new biography on which this reviewer has not written in the margin either &#34;oh no&#34; or &#34;Oh God&#34;...O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s book largely refrains from psychological speculation, and I can&#39;t decide whether that&#39;s a good thing.

Ulysse's debut provides the rare opportunity to peer into the private lives of four secretive Haitian families. The interwoven narrative spans four decades--from 1970 through 2010--and drifts among various provinces in Haiti, the United States, churches, vodun temples, schools, strip clubs, and the grave. Ulysse introduces us to a childless Haitian American couple risking it all for a baby to call their own; a Florida-based predatory schoolteacher threatening students with deportation if they expose him; and the unforgettable Monsieur Boursicault, whose chain of funeral parlors makes him the wealthiest man in Haiti. This daring work of fiction is a departure from the standard narrative of political unrest on the island.

His up-close-and-personal profiles of John, Paul, George, and Ringo probe their true personalities and reveal their amazing lifestyles as no other book has done Barrow gives a devastatingly honest, powerfully authoritative, and absolutely credible eyewitness account of how his history-making clients acted in and out of the spotlight. Also published here for the first time is his astonishing collection of photographs, including candid snapshots taken in the sanctuary of dressing rooms and hotel suites from where press and paparazzi were excluded. Barrow watched the Beatles&#39; &#34;greatest gig of all&#34; at New York&#39;s Shea Stadium and, at Paul&#39;s request, he made a personal souvenir recording of The Beatles&#39; final concert at San Francisco&#39;s Candlestick Park. The author lets his quirky Liverpudlian sense of humor run all through the text because &#34;rock &#39;n&#39; roll was never invented to be taken too seriously.&#34;</p><p>A career-long professional writer and PR consultant, Tony Barrow was The Beatles' publicist between 1962 when they issued their first single "Love Me Do", and 1968, when they set up their own management company.<br><br>Barrow coined The Beatles' nickname the "Fab Four", wrote the sleeve notes for a number of the group's album covers, set up their huge international press conferences, selected their media interviews and fixed up their photo shoots at home and abroad during the touring years, and finally collaborated with Paul McCartney in 1967 to compile the cartoon-strip story booklet that came with The Beatles' <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> recordings. He is one of a tiny handful of surviving eyewitnesses able to write a first-hand account of life within The Beatles' close-knit entourage and the only remaining professional writer from that circle.<br><br>Few were closer to The Beatles than Tony Barrow, and this is not merely a biography of the Fab Four, but a unique and vividly personal memoir by an author who knew John, Paul, George and Ringo as friends throughout the height of their fame.<br>Barrow, the media agent who concocted the Fab Four's nickname, weighs in with a raucous re-telling of the Beatlemania years that follows the foppish rockers from a Manchester Square pub in 1962 through world tours, stadium gigs, movie deals, death, controversy and chaos. Chapters are devoted to painting "a sad and desperately lonely picture of The Beatles' millionaire manager," Brian Epstein, and his downward spiral into fatal drug addiction; profiling band members and their sundry girlfriends and wives; and recounting behind-the-scenes moments during recording sessions or while on the road. Highlights include Barrow's description of the band's beeline ascent to stardom following the release of their first Parlophone single, "Love Me Do;" their ill-fated trip to Manila in the summer of 1966, when they inadvertently snubbed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda by missing a luncheon at which they were the guests of honor; and their attempts to deal with the backlash that ensued after John Lennon claimed the Beatles were more popular than Jesus. Beatles fans will know much of this story, but Barrow's swift telling and catchy prose makes for an addictive read that still manages a few surprises. 24 pages color and b&amp;w photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Loneliness may be more pervasive now than at any other time in human history. Cell phones and "instant messaging" not withstanding, our longing for meaningful connections seems to increase in direct proportion to our accessibility.<br><br>In <i>The Restless Heart</i>, Ronald Rolheiser identifies different types of loneliness and discusses the dangers and opportunities they represent in our lives. Using contemporary parables from literature, film, and his own life, he shows that loneliness can be a tremendously creative and even valuable force when it is recognized, accepted and used as a dynamic catalyst. With his trademark clarity of vision, honesty, and intelligence, Rolheiser offers a distinctively Christian approach to living an examined, involved life and presents suggestions that will free readers to discover greater meaning and fulfillment in their own lives.</p></p><p><p>RONALD ROLHEISER, O.M.I., is a specialist in the fields of spirituality and systematic theology.

Rich and poor, wise and ignorant, faith-filled and agnostic, healthy and unhealthy have all alike had to face and struggle with its potentially paralyzing grip. It has granted no immunities. To be human is to be lonely.<br><br>To be human, however, is also to respond. The human person has always responded to this pain. The response has varied greatly. Sometimes loneliness has led us to new heights of creativity, and sometimes it has led us to drugs, alcohol, and emotional paralysis; sometimes it has led us to the true encounter of love and authentic sexuality, sometimes it has led us into dehumanizing relationships and destructive sexuality; sometimes it has moved us to a greater depth of openness toward God and others, to fuller life, and sometimes it has led us to jump off bridges, to end life; sometimes it has given us a glimpse of heaven, sometimes it has given us a glimpse of hell; sometimes it has made the human spirit, sometimes it has broken it; always it has affected it. For loneliness is one of the deepest, most universal, and most profound experiences that we have.<br><br>Even if you are a relatively happy person, a person who relates easily to others and who has many close friends, you are probably still lonely at times. If you are a very sensitive person, who feels things deeply, you are probably, to some degree, lonely all the time.<br><br>However, most of us appear reluctant to admit our loneliness, even to ourselves. All of us seem to have a congenital need to deny that we experience loneliness and that it is, in some way, responsible for many of our feelings, actions, and pursuits. We distance ourselves from it, not admitting to ourselves and to others that we are lonely. We admit that we are lonely only with a feeling of shame and weakness. Also, most of us feel that loneliness is not something that should affect normal, healthy persons. We identify it much more with those that our society considers marginal persons, namely, the elderly, the unwanted, the unlovable, the alienated, and those others who for one reason or another seem divorced from the mainstream of life. We never imagine for a moment that we should be subject to intense feelings of loneliness.<br><br>Under the surface, though, we are not easily fooled by our own facade of strength. We hurt, and we live in pain, in loneliness, damned loneliness. Unfortunately, too, the cost of our self-deception is high. We pay a heavy price for not admitting our loneliness, facing it squarely, and grappling with it honestly. Loneliness, as we shall see, is most dangerous when it is not recognized, accepted, and worked through creatively. It is then that it wreaks havoc with our lives. Conversely, too, we shall see that it is a tremendously creative and humanizing force when it is recognized and addressed correctly.<br>THE HIDDEN FACE OF LONELINESS<br>Despite our denials of loneliness, evidence for it is everywhere. It does not require professional insight, nor much documentation, to affirm the fact that as a society, and as individuals, we are lonely. All we need to do is to look around ourselves, or deeply inside ourselves, to see evidence of loneliness, staggering, painful evidence. For example, even a quick look at the grim statistics that document the use of alcohol, drugs (both hard and soft), the sale of pornographic materials, and the number of suicides tells us that we are a lonely people, living in pain. In our western world, we consume millions of pounds of tranquilizers and barbiturates annually. At the same time each year, we see an increase in the number of persons who are seeking professional counseling, suffering from nervous strain and mental disorders, getting involved in encounter groups, sensitivity groups, religious fads, newer forms of communal and marital living, and promiscuous sexuality.<br><br>Granted, all these things are not necessarily indicative of loneliness; other factors are often present. However, loneliness is certainly a large factor in bringing about many of these phenomena.<br><br>We see concomitant phenomena in other areas. Over recent decades, we have seen the motif of loneliness emerging more and more within philosophy, art, literature, psychology, and religious and social thought. The so-called pop arts, modern music, movies, literature, popular magazines, and the like have also focused much on loneliness as one of their major and more interesting themes. The prevalence and popularity of this theme in so much recent thought and art suggest that our hearts tend to resonate when we hear talk of loneliness.<br><br>Perhaps the clearest example of this is popular music. Music, like other art forms, becomes popular only when it communicates some human experience. The popularity, therefore, of much of our modern rock music, particularly of the poorer variety, is confusing to people who judge music solely by the quality of its melody, harmony, symmetry, and lyrics. Much of our modern rock music, in comparison to classical music, is weak in all these aspects. Yet millions flock to listen to this music, to buy recordings of it. Why? The reason is quite simply that it speaks to people. In some ways, and at various times in our lives, these grinding guitars and booming drums (complete with a writhing singer) capture more explicitly the confusion, the torment, the pain, and the loneliness of our minds than do the symphonies of Beethoven and other such classics. In many ways, the rock music of our age speaks to our culture in the way the blues spoke to the oppressed and enslaved blacks during their days of enslavement. We like a music when "it fits," when it strikes a chord inside us.<br><br>Who more acutely symbolizes the pain of our age than the gyrating, writhing rock singer, screaming into an ultrasensitive microphone, nearly drowned out by guitars and drums, trying desperately to communicate, to penetrate someone's ears and heart--if, in no other way, than at least through the sheer force of sound? His records sell because the gyrating and writhing of his music and his body is not unlike our minds and hearts, which also gyrate and writhe as they struggle to communicate, struggle to make contact, struggle to penetrate, struggle to pierce the riddle that separates us from the minds and hearts of others. We, too, are desperately trying to communicate, in whatever fashion possible!<br><br>However, even if there were no poets, no artists, no musicians, no professional commentators to point out our loneliness to us, we would still be acutely aware of being lonely; the voice of our heart, most often making itself heard through pain, is more than sufficient to tell us this.<br><br>We are many different persons who make up the human race. Regardless of our differences, and regardless of whatever hand of cards life has dealt us, our hearts all speak the same language, the language of love. Part of the language of love, though, is also the language of pain and loneliness. We yearn for full, all-consuming love and ecstatic union with God or with others. Reality, however, does not always deal in dreams and yearnings. Consequently, we go through life experiencing not just love, but frustration, restlessness, tension, and loneliness, as well. In life, all of us are somewhat frustrated in our deep desire to share our being and our richness with others. We live knowing that others do not fully know and understand us and that others can never fully know and understand us, that they are "out there" and we are "in here." St. Paul calls this living as "through a glass, darkly," a riddle, a veil, a mist of unreality that separates us from God and others, and from what is authentically real (1 Cor. 13:12-13).<br><br>Our hearts were not built to live as through a "glass, darkly," but to be in consummate union with God and others. And so, as we try to sort our way through the mist of unreality, the riddle of life, our hearts are lonely and, thus, speak to us of not just love, but also of pain. At times, the pain is not so poignant and we feel close to God and others. At other times, the pain becomes unbearable and we are given a foretaste of hell, realizing that loneliness is the ultimate threat, the final terror that can relativize all else. Mostly, though, the pain is tolerable, but nagging: a dissatisfaction with the quality of our life and our relationships to people, a frustration without an object, a yearning without a particular reference, a nostalgia for past moments and friends, a restlessness that prevents us from relaxing and from being present to the moment, a feeling of alienation, a paranoia, a sense of missing out on something, an inexplicable emptiness.<br><br>Too often, though, we run from these feelings of loneliness, thinking that there is something wrong with us. We guard our loneliness from others, keeping it private, like an object of shame. Yet other hearts speak the same language as ours. Carl Rogers, psychologist and well-known therapist, once said:<br><br>I have most invariably found that the very feeling which has seemed to me most private, most personal and hence, most incomprehensible by others, has turned out to be an expression for which there is a resonance in many people. It has led me to believe that what is most personal and unique in each of us is probably the very element which would, if it were shared and expressed, speak most deeply to others.1<br><br>Our experience of loneliness is surely such an experience; perhaps the very one that Rogers had most in mind. Loneliness is not a rare and curious phenomenon. It is at the center of every person's ordinary life experience.<br><br>We live as through a glass, darkly, in a mist of unreality that keeps our hearts in the pain of unconsummated love. This is the pain of loneliness. We do a lot of daydreaming about fulfillment and, on days when the pain gets bad, perhaps we cry a little. But mostly we are silent, silent about our loneliness and the deep pulses inside us that make our being tick.<br>AN INTENS...</p><h2>Gay Soul: Finding the Heart of Gay Spirit and Nature With Sixteen Writers, Healers, Teachers, and Visionaries</h2><p>Gay spirituality and sensibility come to light in these pages of striking portraits and trenchant interviews. Thompson brings out the unique contributions of the esteemed gay men - including Will Roscoe, Joseph Kramer, Harry Hay, James Broughton, Andrew Harvey, Paul Monette, Malcolm Boyd, and Ram Dass - who lead the spiritual life.Thompson elicits vivid musings on such provocative issues as the third gender, S&amp;M, ritual as `holy fire', and spirituality in the age of Aids. His interviews call out the deepest emotions of each of these vibrant leaders who reveal, as never before, the spirit and the soul of the gay life.</p><p>Thompson (Gay Spirit, St. Martin's, 1987) plumbs "the potentialities of otherness" in these compelling interviews with a remarkably diverse, insightful roster of gay men, all of whom ponder and exemplify the spiritual possibilities of the gay experience. At 81, poet and filmmaker James Broughton is yet the imp of the collection, gleefully exhorting readers to revel in "the delicious absurdities of the world." Spiritual activist Ram Dass invites us to understand suffering as grace, to see one's "incarnation as a curriculum." Jungian psychotherapist Robert Hopcke suggests that drag queens embody the trickster archetype in American culture. And anthropologist Will Roscoe sees promise in the Native American berdache tradition of the third cultural gender accepted because he "mediates the divisions and contradictions within the community." Rife with uncommon visions, Gay Soul is an excellent sourcebook of psychical constructions of queerness.<br><i>Thomas Tavis, San Francisco P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Didn&#39;t Ask to Be in This Family: Sibling Relationships and How They Shape Adult Behavior and Dependencies</h2><p>In their third collaboration, an insightful therapist-cartoonist team explores sibling rivalries and relationships and how these early behavioral patterns affect us for the rest of our lives.

Rebecca has determined that she will find an ovenbird in Teatown Woods in the Hudson Highlands of New York. The story is a vehicle for introducing the wildlife inhabiting the five layers of plant life in the woodlandsthe canopy, shrub, field, litter, and soil. Rebecca's encounters with various animals are gentle and respectful. One mishap occurs when Rebecca's forgotten magnifying glass catches the sun and starts a small fire; no drama ensues, for this is a sensible child who knows just what to do, supplying a small lesson in outdoor safety. The day climaxes at sunset with the appearance of the ovenbird and a concert of amazingly varied sound. Pleasing pencil drawings depict the animals in varied degrees of realism and follow some of Rebecca's activities. The repeated reference to animals as "wizards of the woods" adds a precious note to the quiet tale, and the slim book with its spacious format has a "young" look which belies the more difficult reading level of the text. This approach to natural history appeals to certain readers, and the volumes offer creative teaching possibilities.

In <i>The Jews of Georgian England</i>, Todd M. Endelman challenges the Germanocentric orientation of the bulk of modern Jewish historiography and argues that the modernization of European Jewry encompassed far more than an intellectual revolution.<br>His study recounts the rise of the Anglo-Jewish elite--great commercial and financial magnates such as the Goldsmids, the Franks, Samson Gideon, and Joseph Salvador--who rapidly adopted the gentlemanly style of life of the landed class and adjusted their religious practices to harmonize with the standards of upper-class Englishmen. Similarly, the Jewish poor--peddlers, hawkers, and old-clothes men--took easily to many patterns of lower-class life, including crime, street violence, sexual promiscuity, and coarse entertainment.<br>An impressive marshaling of fact and analysis, <i>The Jews of Georgian England</i> serves to illuminate a significant aspect of the Jewish passage to modernity.<br>"Contributes to English as well as Jewish history. . . . Every reader will learn something new about the statistics, setting or mores of Jewish life in the eighteenth century. . . ." --<i>American Historical Review</i><br>Todd M.

Journeying from Salala in Oman on the Arabian Sea, they headed north and east for 1,200 kilometres across remote and largely unexplored desert wilderness, where ranges of sand dunes tower to over three hundred metres in height. When they finally reached Abu Dhabi on the Persian Gulf, they were received as heroes. Theirs was the first camel crossing of the Empty Quarter in over fifty years.<br><br>The expedition had historic roots, since the team sought to retrace for the first time the original 1947 crossing by world-famous explorer and adventurer Sir Wilfred Thesiger. In the years since Sir Wilfred?s journey, Arabia and the Bedu have faced enormous upheaval. The discovery of oil precipitated rapid and irreversible changes to a nomadic society that had existed in relative isolation since the time of Mohammed. Travelling with their three Bedu companions, the team was afforded a rare glimpse of how these changes have affected the last of the Arabian nomads.<br><br>During the desert crossing the team was determined to travel and live as authentically as possible, on camels, taking Arabic names and wearing traditional clothing, drinking their water from rank goatskins and eating mainly unleavened bread and dried camel meat. The cultural insights they were afforded are constantly fascinating ? but so are the cultural clashes, since the party was often followed by Land Cruisers full of well-meaning supporters who threatened to destroy the spirit of the journey.<br><br>The expedition was also full of adventure and incident ? such as a hundred-foot descent down a narrow, snake-infested well, a three-day sandstorm, the sting of a desert scorpion, and the challenge of living with inescapable heat and nagging dehydration.<br><br>The Empty Quarter Traverse received considerable media coverage, both nationally and internationally. In nineteen countries around the world, 22,000 school children enrolled in the team?s Internet education program, and 4.8 million people visited the expedition Web site. The trek was reported widely and was the subject of a feature story on the CBC <i>National</i> and a front-page colour photo story in the <i>National Post</i>.<br><br>Now Bruce Kirkby has written a thoughtful and deeply felt account of this challenging expedition ? and has illustrated it with twenty-four pages of his stunning colour photographs. Anyone interested in remote areas of the world or stirred by the romance of old-fashioned adventure and daring will find <i>Sand Dance</i> constantly engaging.<b>Bruce Kirkby</b> has pursued a life of adventure, undertaking major expeditions to remote locations around the globe. After graduating in Engineering Physics from Queen&#x2019;s University, Bruce had a brief (six-month) office career, before his love of the wilderness and a craving for physical challenge tore him away.<br><br>A professional guide, Bruce has spent much of the last ten years in arduous environments, leading whitewater rafting and canoe expeditions on remote northern rivers (including the Tatshenshini, Nahanni, Firth, and Burnside), jungle explorations in the Central American rainforest, and sea-kayak voyages along Belize&#x2019;s barrier reef.

Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is the author of <i>Our Fathers, Be Near Me, The Illuminations</i>, among other books. He lives in London.<p>&#x201c;Andrew O'Hagan has created a story that is both a howl against the war in Afghanistan and the societies that have blindly abetted it, and a multilayered, deeply felt tale of family, loss, memory, art, loyalty, secrecy and forgiveness.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dani Shapiro, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Illuminations</i>] moves with bold, imaginative daring and a troubled intensity between men at war and women with their children, between Scotland and Afghanistan, between photography and fiction, and between memory and secrets . . . The virtuosity of the novel, and also its riskiness, is in the violent contrast between the world of women, families and art, and the world of war . . . [<i>The Illuminations</i>] is using the real world to ask real, difficult and important questions: about how the truth gets reshaped and rearranged, and about whether, under every kind of circumstance, it is possible to be true to yourself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Hermione Lee, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;It's a measure of O'Hagan's compassion that after balancing these stories of war and family - braving the battlefield and braving the passing of time - the ultimate note is hopeful and almost gentle, of something that seems real and vital.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lucy Daniel, <i>The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Illuminations</i>] is immensely generous and wholly committed to conveying the complex intelligence of its large and varied cast of characters. The men and women who meet in these pages are as full of contradictions, and as mysterious to others--and to themselves--as real human beings . . . The novel is at once dramatically plotted and leisurely enough to sustain a series of meditations on consciousness, memory, loyalty, identity, friendship, love, and history . . . <i>The Illuminations </i>misses nothing, and we can be grateful for the energy and the intelligence with which O'Hagan has presented us with the complexity of human consciousness, and has managed to convey both the beauty and the harshness of the world in which his characters--and his readers--live.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Francine Prose, Prospect</i></p><p>&#x201c;Andrew O'Hagan could well win the Man Booker prize of this, his fifth work of fiction. Myself I'd give <i>The Illuminations</i> two Bookers . . . You could argue (as I would) that only in fiction as good as this will you find war, sex, nationalism and the care of the elderly, truthfully handled. The illuminations is a novel which validates the greatness of fiction in hands as masterly as Andrew O'Hagan. Read it and see what I mean.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Sutherland, <i>The Times (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;As if it is not enough that Andrew O'Hagan can write like an angel, one has to add that he does it in the style of an intelligent angel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Norman Mailer on Andrew O'Hagan</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Illuminations</i> is a natural extension of O'Hagan's earlier work (aided in part by the reappearance of characters from previous novels) but also an elaborate and ambitious departure from it . . . with two Booker Prize-nominations to his name, [O'Hagan] is a skilled yet criminally undervalued storyteller. With luck, this masterful novel will bring him the wider readership he deserves.&#x201d; &#x2015;Malcolm Forbes, <i>Star Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Illuminations</i> is deftly orchestrated and quietly moving . . .

Born in 1898 to wealthy American parents in upstate New York, Sage spent most of her childhood and young adult years in Italy and France. In 1937 she moved to Paris, where she became a member of the Surrealist group surrounding Andr� Breton. She returned to the United States in 1940, settling in Woodbury, Connecticut. Her most productive years as an artist extended from roughly 1938 through the late 1950s, when her health began to deteriorate and she withdrew gradually from social contact. She stopped working on her oil paintings in 1958 but continued to forge her increasingly nihilistic poems until she shot herself in the heart in January 1963.&nbsp;Along with her eloquent chronicle of Sage&#x2019;s life, Judith D. Suther presents subtle, revelatory views of Sage&#x2019;s artistic accomplishments. She takes us into the artist&#x2019;s elegant, dreamlike paintings, connecting them to Sage&#x2019;s complex inner life and to the artistic and intellectual worlds in which she moved. Suther also shows how the raw language and iconoclastic themes of Sage&#x2019;s poetic works were related to Sage&#x2019;s lifelong revolt against social and artistic convention.</p><p>Judith D.

Carlo Ancelotti is one of only six people to have won the Champions League&#x2014;European soccer&#x2019;s most coveted trophy&#x2014;as both player and coach. After a successful career playing for several of the most important teams in Italy&#x2014;and for the Italian national team&#x2014;Ancelotti went on to become one of the most acclaimed and outspoken coaches in European football, managing Italian giants Parma, Juventus, and Milan before moving to Chelsea, one of the Premier League&#x2019;s most successful clubs, in 2009. The book moves from anecdotes of his life growing up in Reggio Emilia to stories of his time playing among the best footballers in the world. With a characteristic mixture of sharp insight and humor, Ancelotti explores the differences between the Italian and the English games, shares his thoughts on soccer&#x2019;s future with the MLS in America, and reflects on the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. With a preface by the legendary former captain of the Italian national team, Paolo Maldini, this book is at once a tactician&#x2019;s bible from one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated footballing minds, the fascinating story of an ordinary man reaching great heights, and in part a revealing tell-all from an outspoken insider in the cut-throat world of European soccer.

Admittedly the appointments were cleaner and newer, and there was a certain opulence to the gold tassels that fringed the seat cushions in the first-class carriage, but these were just a matter of superficial decoration. The differences that made this train unique in England, which was the same as saying unique in the entire world, were not yet apparent as the great golden engine nosed its way over the maze of tracks and switches of the station yards, then out through the tunnels and cuttings. Here the roadbed was ordinary and used by all trains alike. Only when the hulking locomotive and its trailing cylinder of closely joined coaches had dived deep under the Thames and emerged in Surrey did the real difference show. For now even the roadbed became unusual, a single track of continuously welded rails on specially cushioned sleepers that was straighter and smoother than any track had ever been before, sparkling in deep cuttings that slashed a direct channel through the chalk of the downs, shooting arrow-straight across the streams on stumpy iron bridges, a no-nonsense rail line that changed direction only in the longest and shallowest of curves. The reason for this became quickly apparent as the acceleration of the train steadily increased until the nearby fields and trees flashed by, visible as just the most instantaneous of green blurs; only in the distance could details be picked out, but they too slipped backwards and vanished almost as soon as they had appeared.<br>Albert Drigg had the entire compartment to himself, and he was very glad of that. Although he knew that this train had made the return trip from Penzance every day for almost a year now and had suffered no mishap, he was aware of this only in theory, so that now experiencing it in practice was a totally different matter. From London to Penzance was a total of 282 miles and that entire incredible distance would be covered in exactly two hours and five minutes&#x2014;an average speed including stops of well in excess of 150 miles per hour. Was man meant to go that fast? Albert Drigg had a strong visceral sensation that he was not. Not even in this year of Our Lord 1973, modern and up-to-date though the empire was. Sitting so bolt upright in his black suit and black waistcoat that they showed no wrinkles, his stiff white collar shining, his gleaming leather portfolio on his knees, he generated no sign of his internal emotions. On the rack above, his tightly rolled umbrella and black bowler indicated he was a city man and men of the city of London are just not given to expressing their innermost feelings in public. Nevertheless he could not suppress a slight start when the compartment door whisked open on silent runners and a cheerful cockney voice addressed him.<br>&#x201c;Tea, sir, tea?&#x201d;<br>One hundred and fifty miles an hour&#x2014;or more!&#x2014;and the cup remained in place on the ledge beneath the window while the tea poured into it in a steady stream.<br>&#x201c;That will be thrupence, sir.&#x201d;<br>Drigg took a sixpence from his pocket and passed it over to murmured thanks, then instantly regretted his largesse as the door closed again. He must be unnerved if he tipped in so magnanimous a manner, but he was solaced by the fact that he could put it on the expense account since he was traveling on company business. And the tea was good, freshly brewed and hot, and did very much to soothe his nerves. A whisky would do a lot more he realized, and he almost touched the electric button for the waiter when he remembered the Saloon Car, often seen in the pages of The Tatler and Pall Mall Gazette, but visited only by the very few. He finished the tea and rose, tucking the extra length of chain back into his sleeve. It bothered him that the portfolio was irremovably shackled to the cuff around his wrist and indicated that he was something less than a completed gentleman, but by careful maneuvering he could keep the chain from the public view. The Saloon Car, that was the very thing!<br>The carpeting in the corridor was a deep gold in color, making a subtle contrast with the ruddy, oiled gloss of the mahogany paneling. Drigg had to pass through another coach to reach the Saloon Car, but there was no need to struggle with recalcitrant doors as on an ordinary train, for as he approached, some concealed device detected his proximity and the doors opened swiftly before him to the accompaniment of the hum of hidden electric motors. Naturally he did not look through the compartment windows he passed, but out of the corners of his eyes he had quick glimpses of finely dressed men and elegantly attired women, some children sitting sedately, reading&#x2014;then a sudden loud barking that inadvertently drew his eye. Two country gentlemen sat with their feet up, emptying a bottle of port between them while a half dozen hounds of various breeds and sizes milled around and sought after their attention. And then Drigg was at the Saloon Car.<br>No automatic devices here but the best of personal services. A grand carved door with massive brass handles and a pillbox-capped boy, his double row of uniform buttons glinting and catching the eye, who saluted and tugged at the handles.<br>&#x201c;Welcome, sir,&#x201d; he piped, &#x201c;to the Grand Saloon Car of the London and Land&#x2019;s End Railway.&#x201d;<br>Now that he saw it in its full splendor Drigg realized that the newspaper photographs did not do the establishment justice. There was no feeling at all of being in a railway carriage, for the atmosphere was rather that of an exceedingly exclusive club. One side contained immense crystal windows, from floor to ceiling, framed by ruddy velvet curtains, while arrayed before them were the tables where the clientele could sit at their leisure and watch the rural countryside speeding by. The long bar was opposite, massed with ranked bottles that reflected in the fine cut-glass mirror behind it. There were windows to the right and left of the bar, delicately constructed stained-glass windows through which the sun poured to throw shifting colored patterns upon the carpet. No saints here, unless they be the saints of railroading, like Stephenson or Brunel, sturdy, far-seeing men with compasses and charts in hand. They were flanked by the engines of history with Captain Dick&#x2019;s Puffer and the tiny Rocket on the left, then progressing through history and time to the far right where the mighty atomic-powered Dreadnought appeared, the juggernaut of the rails that pulled this very train. Drigg sat near the window, his portfolio concealed beneath the table, and ordered his whisky, sipping at it slowly while he enjoyed the gay music-hall tune that a smiling musician was playing on the organ at the far end of the car.<br>This was indeed luxury, and he relished every moment of it, already seeing the dropping jaws and mute stares of respect when he told the lads about it back at The King&#x2019;s Head in Hampstead. Before he had as much as finished his first drink the train was easing to a stop in Salisbury, where he looked on approvingly as a policeman appeared to chase from the platform a goggling of boys in school jackets who stood peering into the car. His duty done, the officer raised his hand in salute to the occupants, then rolled majestically and flat-footedly on about his official affairs. Once more the Flying Cornishman hurled itself down the track, and with his second whisky Drigg ordered a plate of sandwiches, still eating them at the only other stop, in Exeter, while they were scarcely done before the train slowed for Penzance and he had to hurry back for his hat and umbrella.<br>The guards were lined up beside the locomotive when he passed, burly, no-nonsense-looking soldiers of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, elegant in their dark kilts and white gaiters, impressive in the steadiness of their Lee-Enfield rifles with fixed bayonets. Behind them was the massive golden bulk of the Dreadnought, the most singular and by far the most powerful engine in the world. Despite the urgency of his mission Drigg slowed, as did all the other passengers, unable calmly to pass the gleaming length of her. Black driving wheels as tall as his head, drive rods thicker than his legs that emerged from swollen cylinders leaking white plumes of steam from their exhausts. She was a little travel-stained about her lower works, but all her outer skin shone with the seamless, imprisoned-sunlight glow of gold, fourteen-karat gold plating, a king&#x2019;s ransom on a machine this size. But it wasn&#x2019;t the gold the soldiers were here to guard, though that was almost reason enough, but the propulsive mechanism hidden within that smooth, unbroken, smoke-stackless shell. An atomic reactor, the government said, and little else, and kept its counsel. And guarded its engine. Any of the states of Germany would give a year&#x2019;s income for this secret while spies had already been captured who, it was rumored, were in the employ of the King of France. The soldiers sternly eyed the passersby, and Drigg hurried on.<br>The works offices were upstairs in the station building, and a lift carried him swiftly to the fourth floor. He was reaching for the door to the executive suite when it opened and a man emerged, a navvy from the look of him, for who else but a railway navvy would wear such knee-high hob-nailed boots along with green corduroy trousers? His shirt was heavy canvas and over it he wore a grimy but still rainbow waistcoat, while around his pillarlike neck was wrapped an even gaudier handkerchief. He held the door but barred Drigg&#x2019;s way, looking at him closely with his pale-blue eyes which were startlingly clear in the tanned nutbrown of his face.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Mr. Drigg, aren&#x2019;t you, sir?&#x201d; he asked before the other could protest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen you here when they cut t&#x2019;tape and at other official functions of t&#x2019;line.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If you please.&#x201d;<br>The thick-thewed arm still prevented his entra...</p></p><h2>Zmirot Anthology</h2><p>(Tara Books).

Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener&#39;s hand is severed as &#34;the dome&#34; comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when -- or if -- it will go away.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan Reviews <em>Under the Dome</em></strong><br><br> <b>Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan share their enthusiasm for Stephen King's thriller, <i>Under the Dome</i>. This pair of reviewers knows a thing or two about the art of crafting a great thriller. Del Toro is the Oscar-nominated director of international blockbuster films, including <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> and <em>Hellboy</em>. Hogan is the author of several acclaimed novels, including <em>The Standoff</em> and <em>Prince of Thieves</em>, which won the International Association of Crime Writer's Dashiell Hammett Award in 2005. The two recently collaborated to write the bestselling horror novel, <em>The Strain</em>, the first of a proposed trilogy. Read their exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Under the Dome</i>:</b><br><br> The first thing readers might find scary about Stephen King's <i>Under The Dome</i> is its length. The second is the elaborate town map and list of characters at the front of the book (including "Dogs of Note"), which sometimes portends, you know, heavy lifting. Don't you believe it. Breathless pacing and effortless characterization are the hallmarks of King's best books, and here the writing is immersive, the suspense unrelenting. The pages turn so fast that your hand--or Kindle-clicking thumb--will barely be able to keep up. <p></p> <p> <i>You Are Here.</i> </p> <p> Nobody yarns a &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; like Stephen King. Nobody. The implausibility of a dome sealing off an entire city--a motif seen before in pulp magazines and on comic book covers--is given the most elaborate real-life alibi by crafting details, observations, and insights that make us nod silently while we read. Promotional materials reference <em>The Stand</em> in comparison, but we liken <i>Under The Dome</i> more to King's excellent novella, <em>The Mist</em>: another locked-door situation on an epic scale, a tour-de-force in which external stressors bake off the civility of a small town full of dark secrets, exposing souls both very good...and very, very bad.</p> <p> Yes, "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street," but there is so much more this time. The expansion of King&#x2019;s diorama does not simply take a one-street fable and turn it into a town, but finds new life for old archetypes, making them morally complex and attuned to our world today. It makes them relevant and affecting once again. And the beauty of it all is that the final lesson, the great insight that is gained at the end of this draining journey, is not a righteous 1950&#x2019;s sermon but an incredibly moving and simple truth. A nugget of wisdom you'll be using as soon as you turn the last page. </p> <p> <i>This Is Now.</i> </p> <p> Along the way, you get bravura writing, especially featuring the town kids, and a delicious death aria involving one of the most nefarious characters--who dies alone, but not really--as well as a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a cameo (of sorts) by none other than Jack Reacher. Indeed--whether during a much-needed comfort break, or a therapeutic hand-flexing--you may find yourself wondering, "Is this a horror novel? Or is it a thriller?" The answer, of course, is: Yes, yes, yes. </p> <p> <i>"...the blood hits the wall like it always hits the wall."</i> </p> <p> It seems impossible that, as he enters his sixth decade of publishing, the dean of dark fiction could add to his vast readership. But that is precisely what will happen...when the Dome drops.</p><p> <i>Now Go Read It. --Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan</i></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p> <p><strong>The Story Behind the Cover</strong><br>Click on image to enlarge </p><p> </p><p> The jacket concept for <i>Under the Dome</i> originated as an ambitious idea from the mind of Stephen King. The artwork is a combination of photographs, illustration and 3-D rendering. This is a departure from the direction of King's most recent illustrated covers. <br><br> In order to achieve the arresting image for this jacket, Scribner art director Rex Bonomelli had to seek out artists who could do a convincing job of creating a realistic portrayal of the town of Chester's Mill, the setting of the novel. Bonomelli found the perfect team of digital artists, based in South America and New York, whose cutting edge work had previously been devoted to advertisement campaigns. This was their first book jacket and an exciting venture for them. "They are used to working with the demands of corporate clients," says Bonomelli. "We gave them freedom and are thrilled with what they came up with." <br><br> The CGI (computer generated imagery) enhanced image looks more like something made for the big screen than for the page and is sure to make a lasting impact on King fans. <br></p><p></p> <p><strong>Meet the Characters</strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b>Dale Barbara</b><br>Barbie, a drifter, ex-army, walks with a burden of guilt from the time he spent in Iraq.

She is the recipient of many state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, and the Garden State Children's Choice Award. She lives in Great Neck, NY, and Wilmington, VT.</p><p></p><p>Johanna Hurwitz always knew she wanted to be a writer. She started by telling stories to her brother, who is six years her junior, and she's been making up stories ever since. Born and raised in New York City, she earned her B.A. degree from Queens College and went on to receive a master's in library science from Columbia University. She embarked on a career as a children's librarian, but she never forgot that one day she wanted to write books, too.</p><p>She worked at the New York Public Library and in a variety of other public and school library positions. She also taught graduate courses in children's literature and storytelling at Queens College. When she and her husband, Uri--a college teacher and writer-and their children, Nomi and Beni, moved to Long Island, she continued her library work.</p><p>Although she had told original stories to her children, it was not until they were well along in school that Mrs. Hurwitz actually began to write down her stories. That's why, when children ask her how long it takes to write a book, she replies that her first, <i>Busybody Nora</i>, took her whole life.</p><p>But since then she has been writing with regularity, portraying with humor and sympathy the everyday incidents that are so important to children. She is particularly fond of seven- to nine-year-olds, because they are " so very open and get excited about small things," and she enjoys writing realistic fiction for and about them.</p><p>That these youngsters are equally fond of Mrs. Hurwitz's books is obvious. She has received many child-chosen state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Wyoming Indian Paintbrush Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, the Garden State Children's Choice Award, the West Virginia Children's Book Award, and others.</p><p>In recent years, Johanna Hurwitz has crisscrossed the United States from Juneau, Alaska, to Jackson, Mississippi, and from San Diego, California, to St. Albans, Vermont. She has even spoken abroad, from Morocco to Mozambique and from Portugal to Nicaragua. On these trips she has met and spoken to schoolchildren, teachers, librarians, and parents. She has made many new friends and has often brought home new ideas for her next book.</p>In this relatively sedate tale featuring Cricket Kaufman and pals, first introduced in Class Clown, Hurwitz takes a break from the series' predominantly school setting. For the bulk of the novel?and all of her spring vacation?Cricket is laid up with a broken ankle. Luckily, the fifth grader's personality, handily revealed through animated conversation and humorous snippets of the girl's thoughts, is sufficiently appealing to carry the plot, which, given the heroine's homebound status, is unavoidably short on action. Cricket's accident comes at the worst possible time, as she must pass up a long-planned trip to Washington, D.C., with the family of her best friend, Zoe. Adding insult to injury, Zoe invites another classmate to go on the trip in Cricket's place. Hurwitz smoothes out that wrinkle with a breezy narrative showing how Cricket's friends and teacher help her cope with her frustration and boredom. Though not as effervescent as the author's tales of Ali Baba Bernstein, Aldo and Elisa, this bright bauble will give fans of Cricket and company a welcome update. Illustrations not seen by PW.

He has won many prizes for his work.Unfolding like an accordion revealing one long, vertical image, Migrant presents a childlike drawing, in charcoal blacks and grays, of numerous minute figures, trees, trains, and houses. An author&#x2019;s note explains the construction of the book (codex) and the unique style of drawing and imagery (amate) before discoursing on the human-rights issues that drive the story. The nine-fold image itself moves from crowded village life through a harrowing train journey to a modern cityscape, all the while accompanied on the left-hand side by the relatively brief but affecting story of a young boy who must leave his small farming village and migrate illegally to Los Angeles. Once there, he, along with his mother and his sisters, finds work, but he still must search for the father who preceded them. A striking, thoughtful, and empathetic look at a difficult and very relevant political issue, Migrant will make an excellent starting point for possible classroom discussions. On the reverse of the English version, the same image is accompanied by a solid, straightforward Spanish translation.

In examining how class, race, and gender play out in the lives of two farm families who simultaneously love and hate the place they can&#x2019;t escape, Lacy Johnson presents rural whiteness as an ethnicity worthy of study. As she dismantles the complex history of a forgotten place while fighting to keep its people whole, Johnson reflects on a place that outsiders can cross into or pass through, but may never fully know.

Children&#39;s BOMC Main.</p><p>Legendary American artist and writer Richard Scarry wrote and illustrated more than 300 books and has sold over 200 million copies worldwide.Scarry's big-hearted, sneaker-wearing worm takes center stage in this posthumously published roundup of all-new escapades. At Lowly Worm's side throughout is amiable Huckle the Cat: the two ride the roller coaster at the Busytown Fair, build a "castle" out of driftwood on the beach, make a birthday gift for Huckle's mother, spend an eventful day in the big city with the Cat family and visit the hospital after a bicycle mishap injures Lowly. With its peripatetic mini-plots, appealingly cluttered art and unfailing cheerfulness, this is standard Scarry fare, right down to its predictably happy ending, in which Lowly (who thought everyone had forgotten his birthday) is given a surprise party. In both art and text, the humor strikes an admirable balance of the understated and the obvious. Kids will chuckle at the portrayal of the interior of a restaurant called Noodle's, where pasta is draped everywhere?even over the waitress, in place of her hair; and at the ludicrously large cast that covers the wounded worm's all-important single "foot."

Europe sees the United States as high-handed, unilateralist, and unnecessarily belligerent; the United States sees Europe as spent, unserious, and weak. The anger and mistrust on both sides are hardening into incomprehension.<br><br>This past summer, in <i>Policy Review</i>, Robert Kagan reached incisively into this impasse to force both sides to see themselves through the eyes of the other. Tracing the widely differing histories of Europe and America since the end of World War II, he makes clear how for one the need to escape a bloody past has led to a new set of transnational beliefs about power and threat, while the other has perforce evolved into the guarantor of that &#x201c;postmodern paradise&#x201d; by dint of its might and global reach. This remarkable analysis is being discussed from Washington to Paris to Tokyo. It is esssential reading.</p><p>From its opening-line salvo&#x2014;"It is time to stop pretending that Europeans and Americans share a common view of the world, or even that they occupy the same world"&#x2014;<i>Of Paradise and Power</i> announces a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Europe. Robert Kagan begins this illuminating essay by laying out the general differences as he sees them: the U.S. is quicker to use military force, less patient with diplomacy, and more willing to coerce (or bribe) other nations in order to get a desired result. Europe, on the other hand, places greater emphasis on diplomacy, takes a much longer view of history and problem solving, and has greater faith in international law and cooperation. Kagan does not view these differences as the result of innate national character, but as a time-honored historical reality--the U.S. is merely behaving like the powerful nation it is, just as the great European nations once did when they ruled the world. Now, Europe must act multilaterally because it has no choice. The "UN Security Council is a substitute for the power they lack," he writes. <p></p><p> Kagan also emphasizes the inherent ironies present in the relationship. European nations have enjoyed an "American security guarantee" for nearly 60 years, allowing them to cut back on defense spending while criticizing the U.S. for not doing the same. Yet Europe relies upon the U.S. for protection. This has led America and Europe to view the same threats much differently, as evidenced by the split over how to deal with Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Kagan points out that some European leaders are more afraid of how the U.S. will wield its power in the Middle East than they are of the thought of Hussein or other "rogue state" leaders acquiring weapons of mass destruction. </p> Kagan&#x2019;s brevity is as impressive as it is appreciated; most writers would have required thrice as many pages to get to their point. At any length, the book is nothing short of brilliant. This is essential reading for those seeking to understand the post-Cold War world. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i>&#x201c;No academic piece in this realm has generated quite as much heat and interest since Samuel Huntington&#x2019;s &#x2018;Clash of Civilizations&#x2019; article in 1993 or Francis Fukuyama&#x2019;s &#x2018;End of History&#x2019; in 1989.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Francois Heisbourg, <i>New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;The most controversial big-think essay of the season.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jay Tolson, <i>U.S. News + World Report<br><br></i>&#x201c;Come the hour, come the book . . . Kagan&#x2019;s book is neither a diatribe nor a polemic. It is a penetrating effort to shed some light on the confusion in transatlantic affairs and to understand why Americans and Europeans are so frequently talking past each other . . .

After first telling readers how he likes all kinds of rice&#x2014;white, brown, fried, stewed&#x2014;award-winning poet Argueta proceeds, making every step in preparing the dish sound like a great adventure. When you sprinkle the rice, it doesn&#x2019;t just hit the pot: little white grains &#x201c;rain music and sing / as they fall.&#x201d; The flames on the stove are &#x201c;rainbow hands,&#x201d; and as the rice cooks, &#x201c;foamy waves and clouds turn the pot / into sea and sky.&#x201d; While the words are evocative and dreamy, Vilela&#x2019;s ink drawings, incorporating collage, rubber stamps, and digital elements, are not only polished and attractive; they put the focus on the fun, including the way the boy dances around the kitchen as the steam from the pot expels white birds. A similarly lyrical Spanish translation appears alongside the English text, making this a wonderful book to use across cultures. One quibble: an actual appended recipe would have been nice. You&#x2019;ll want rice pudding after this.

The superb examples of sculpture illustrated in this volume provide an island-by-island insight into this rich and intriguing heritage. Intrepid seafarers first discovered Polynesia 3000 years ago and, gradually, the region came to be inhabited by the communities established by these explorers. Across central and eastern Polynesia, from the Cook, Austral, Society and Marquesas islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Tahiti, Rapa Nui, the Hawaiian Islands and Aotearoa New Zealand, unique, yet coherent, societies developed. With that a complex and sustaining spiritual world came into being. Sculptures of ancestral gods connected the Polynesians with Te Po, the supernatural world, giving them strength and sacred knowledge. A hierarchy of supernatural beings &#x2015; atua &#x2015; resides within Te Po, inhabiting animals and birds, or particular aspects of the landscape. Among the atua were the deified spirits of human ancestors, particularly those famous for their invincibility, political strength or navigation skill. Polynesians created, revered and communicated with their atua in a relationship of profound intimacy. This way of life suffered a violent rupture with the arrival of Christianity in the 18th century. It is this volume&#x2019;s privilege to chronicle the integral role played by the atua in Polynesian daily life through images and text that convey the power of a still-living culture.</p><p></p><h2>Emmett Kelly, Jr.: Travels Through American History With the World&#39;s Most Famous Hobo Clown</h2><p>Emmett Kelly, Jr. is part of our American culture. He will always be remembered as the most popular clown ever and as the hobo who glorified a romantic period in American history. Originally, &#34;Hoe Boys&#34; were itinerant farm workers who traveled from farm to farm by riding the rails in search of work. Eventually, slang reduced the name to &#34;hobos&#34; as thousands of men continued on the road long after farm work diminished. As a clown, Emmett Kelly, Jr. continued the role of Wearie Willie, the endlessly inept hobo character developed by his father, Emmett Kelly, Sr. Willie represented the harsh days of the Depression, with his sad face and a big red nose swollen from hard luck and booze. &#34;Willie&#39;s a guy who&#39;s lost his last friend but he, himself, always has one ray of hope left&#34;, explains Emmett Jr. Emmett uniquely expresses our greatest wishes and dreams - the dream of hope, the dream of love, the dream of laughter, the dream of kindness. Although he has continued the Wearie Willie personage, Junior added a new twist by merchandising products, which has propelled Emmett Kelly, Jr. to be one the big success stories in the collectible market.</p><p></p><h2>Growing and Selling Fresh-Cut Herbs</h2><p>Successful entrepreneur Sandie Shores offers the only guide for starting an herb business that includes complete growing and harvesting information with savvy advice for starting and maintaining a profitable company.

A list of resources and support publications concludes the book. </p><p> The author takes the mystery out of this business, filling a near vacuum with this reference, but at the same time presents the potential hazards and attention required. One caveat: the black-and-white photos and sketches are generally useful, but one wishes for color pictures of the herbs themselves, given that part of the appeal of fresh herbs is the vibrant color and texture that promise romance to the nose and taste buds. <i>--Molly McElroy</i></p>Learn the secrets of professional herb growers and turn your passion into profits!<p> In this essential handbook for herbal entrepreneurs, you'll find everything you need to know to launch your own business.

He thought crocodiles were a dead-end research topic&#x2014;survivors from the age of the dinosaurs but not much else&#x2014;until he witnessed groups of up to seventy alligators performing mating choruses that included infrasound vibrations&#x2014;a form of communication extremely rare in nature&#x2014;and a &#x201c;dance&#x201d; unknown in the scientific literature but that resembled a scene from <i>Jurassic Park</i>. To prove his thesis about the language of crocodiles, he spent the next six years traveling around the world on shoestring budgets and in extreme circumstances, studying almost every living species. At the same time, as a man desiring companionship in life, he sought love.<br><br>With adventures on five continents, <i>Dragon Songs </i>is his account of this quest. It includes an escape from a boiling lava lake in the Afar Desert, being chased up a tree by a tiger in India, hitching a ride with a cocaine smuggler in Bolivia, and diving with giant Greenland sharks&#x2014;all in the name of studying crocodiles, among which he routinely paddled in his inflatable kayak. Of course, not everything went according to plan. But, in the end, his ground-breaking research helped change the field. And during the course of his adventures, he met and courted his future wife.</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With his artist's eye, scientist precision, and explorer's free spirit, Dinets, a Russian immmigrant and Louisana State University professor, is no ordinary zoologist. Here, he leads readers on an intense and joyous global pursuit of the mating customs of crocodiles ( as well as his own), chroniciling the adventures in fieldwork that would inform his graduate thesis. Along the way, he notes how he prefers assistants "pathologoically prone to risk taking behavior," and on sveral occasions persuaded bush pilots to let him fly their planes -sans license. Dinets is smuggled through Somalia along with "rap music tapes and cases of Coca Cola," and avoids the bandits of Chambal, India (who live near a river filled with hundreds of singing "mugger" crocs); he offers opinions on the politics of science ("negative results are virtually impossible to publish") and seeks out scientific art, like an ancient Chinese "magic bowl" that produces infrasounds- souds at&nbsp;frequencies of less than 20 Hz, the low end of the normal human hearing range&nbsp;- as crocodiles do. Throughout gators and crocs sing, slither, and dance, providing fascinating glimpses of the dinosaurs from which they evolved (the discovery that Siamese crocs feed their yearlings indicates even the earliest dinos may have had "complex parental care"). Dinets offers an exuberant, intelligent take on the adventure of science that has the power to inspire aries of starry-eyed, flack-jacketed Ph.D.'s Photos &amp; maps.</p><p>-Publishers Weekly &nbsp;</p><strong></strong>Vladimir Dinets was born in Russia and immigrated to the United States as a young man. A zoologist interested in animal behavior, he obtained his PhD from the University of Miami in 2011, studying the language of crocodiles, alligators, and their relatives. After obtaining his degree, he worked at Louisiana State University on whooping crane reintroduction and is currently studying play behavior at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a nature photographer and continues to write travel books.

Forty-three years later, in 1941, it was a large modern army ready to wage global war against the Germans and the Japanese. In this definitive social history of America's standing army, military historian Edward Coffman tells how that critical transformation was accomplished. </p><p> Coffman has spent years immersed in the official records, personal papers, memoirs, and biographies of regular army men, including such famous leaders as George Marshall, George Patton, and Douglas MacArthur. He weaves their stories, and those of others he has interviewed, into the story of an army which grew from a small community of posts in China and the Philippines to a highly effective mechanized ground and air force. During these years, the U.S. Army conquered and controlled a colonial empire, military staff lived in exotic locales with their families, and soldiers engaged in combat in Cuba and the Pacific. In the twentieth century, the United States entered into alliances to fight the German army in World War I, and then again to meet the challenge of the Axis Powers in World War II. </p><p> Coffman explains how a managerial revolution in the early 1900s provided the organizational framework and educational foundation for change, and how the combination of inspired leadership, technological advances, and a supportive society made it successful. In a stirring account of all aspects of garrison life, including race relations, we meet the men and women who helped reconfigure America's frontier army into a modern global force. </p></p><p><b>Edward M.

When Waugh was only 11 his father had read an anti-Modernist satire by Ronald Knox, the Catholic writer and theologian, and was &#39;dazzled&#39; by its brilliance. &#39;Since then,&#39; Waugh wrote to Knox years later, &#39;every word you have written and spoken has been pure light to me.&#39; The two remained friends for life, and in 1957, the year of Knox&#39;s death, he asked Waugh to write his biography. What Waugh produced over an intensive period of two years&#39; research and writing is a captivating account of a gifted man, whose unique character and spiritual journey resonate powerfully.</p><p>Evelyn Waugh was born in Hampstead in 1903 and educated at Hertford College, Oxford. In 1928 he published his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was soon followed by Vile Bodies, Black Mischief (1932), A Handful of Dust (1934) and Scoop (1938). During these years he also travelled extensively and converted to Catholicism. In 1939 Waugh was commissioned in the Royal Marines and later transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, experiences which informed his Sword of Honour trilogy (1952-61).

Her mother, a cartographer who creates unusual, hand-painted maps, decides to move Nour and her sisters from New York City back to Syria to be closer to their family. But the country Nour's mother once knew is changing, and it isn't long before protests and shelling threaten their quiet Homs neighborhood. When a shell destroys Nour's house and almost takes her life, she and her family are forced to choose: stay and risk more violence or flee as refugees across seven countries of the Middle East and North Africa in search of safety. As their journey becomes more and more challenging, Nour's idea of home becomes a dream she struggles to remember and a hope she cannot live without. <p></p>More than eight hundred years earlier, Rawiya, sixteen and a widow's daughter, knows she must do something to help her impoverished mother. Restless and longing to see the world, she leaves home to seek her fortune. Disguising herself as a boy named Rami, she becomes an apprentice to al-Idrisi, who has been commissioned by King Roger II of Sicily to create a map of the world. In his employ, Rawiya embarks on an epic journey across the Middle East and the north of Africa where she encounters ferocious mythical beasts, epic battles, and real historical figures. <p></p>A deep immersion into the richly varied cultures of the Middle East and North Africa, <i>The Map of Salt and Stars</i> follows the journeys of Nour and Rawiya as they travel along identical paths across the region eight hundred years apart, braving the unknown beside their companions as they are pulled by the promise of reaching home at last.</p><p>Jennifer Zeynab Joukhadar is a Syrian American author.

When I said good night to him, the white bundle of him sagged so heavy, the hole they dug for him so deep. And there was a hole in me too, and that&#x2019;s where my voice went. It went into the earth with Baba, deep in the white bone of the earth, and now it&#x2019;s gone. My words sunk down like seeds, my vowels and the red space for stories crushed under my tongue.<br> <br>I think Mama lost her words too, because instead of talking, her tears watered everything in the apartment. That winter, I found salt everywhere&#x2014;under the coils of the electric burners, between my shoelaces and the envelopes of bills, on the skins of pomegranates in the gold-trimmed fruit bowl. The phone rang with calls from Syria, and Mama wrestled salt from the cord, fighting to untwist the coils.<br> <br>Before Baba died, we hardly ever got calls from Syria, just emails. But Mama said in an emergency, you&#x2019;ve got to hear a person&#x2019;s voice.<br> <br>It seemed like the only voice Mama had left spoke in Arabic. Even when the neighbor ladies brought casseroles and white carnations, Mama swallowed her words. How come people only ever have one language for grief?<br> <br>That winter was the first time I heard Abu Sayeed&#x2019;s honey-yellow voice. Huda and I sat outside the kitchen and listened sometimes, Huda&#x2019;s ash-brown curls crushed against the doorjamb like spooled wool. Huda couldn&#x2019;t see the color of his voice like I could, but we&#x2019;d both know it was Abu Sayeed calling because Mama&#x2019;s voice would click into place, like every word she&#x2019;d said in English was only a shadow of itself. Huda figured it out before I did&#x2014;that Abu Sayeed and Baba were two knots on the same string, a thread Mama was afraid to lose the end of.<br> <br>Mama told Abu Sayeed what my sisters had been whispering about for weeks&#x2014;the unopened electricity bills, the maps that wouldn&#x2019;t sell, the last bridge Baba built before he got sick. Abu Sayeed said he knew people at the university in Homs, that he could help Mama sell her maps. He asked, what better place to raise three girls than the land that holds their grandparents?<br> <br>When Mama showed us our plane tickets to Syria, the O in my name, Nour, was a thin blot of salt. My older sisters, Huda and Zahra, pestered her about the protests in Dara&#x2019;a, things we had seen on the news. But Mama told them not to be silly, that Dara&#x2019;a was as far south of Homs as Baltimore was from Manhattan. And Mama would know, because she makes maps for a living. Mama was sure things would calm down, that the reforms the government had promised would allow Syria to hope and shine again. And even though I didn&#x2019;t want to leave, I was excited to meet Abu Sayeed, excited to see Mama smiling again.<br> <br>I had only ever seen Abu Sayeed in Baba&#x2019;s Polaroids from the seventies, before Baba left Syria. Abu Sayeed had a mustache and an orange shirt then, laughing with someone out of the frame, Baba always just behind him. Baba never called Abu Sayeed his brother, but I knew that&#x2019;s what he was because he was everywhere: eating iftar on Ramadan evenings, playing cards with Sitto, grinning at a caf� table. Baba&#x2019;s family had taken him in. They had made him their own.<br> <br>When spring came, the horse chestnut trees bloomed white like fat grains of rock salt under our window. We left the Manhattan apartment and the tear-encrusted pomegranates. The plane&#x2019;s wheels lifted like birds&#x2019; feet, and I squinted out the window at the narrow stripe of city where I&#x2019;d lived for twelve whole years and at the hollow green scooped out by Central Park. I looked for Baba. But with the city so far down, I couldn&#x2019;t see the holes anymore.<br> <br>Mama once said the city was a map of all the people who&#x2019;d lived and died in it, and Baba said every map was really a story. That&#x2019;s how Baba was. People paid him to design bridges, but he told his stories for free. When Mama painted a map and a compass rose, Baba pointed out invisible sea monsters in the margins.<br> <br>The winter before Baba went into the earth, he never missed a bedtime story. Some of them were short, like the one about the fig tree that grew in Baba&#x2019;s backyard when he was a little boy in Syria, and some of them were epics so twisting and incredible that I had to wait night after night to hear more. Baba made my favorite one, the story of the mapmaker&#x2019;s apprentice, last two whole months. Mama listened at the door, getting Baba a glass of water when he got hoarse. When he lost his voice, I told the ending. Then the story was ours.<br> <br>Mama used to say stories were how Baba made sense of things. He had to untangle the world&#x2019;s knots, she said. Now, thirty thousand feet above him, I am trying to untangle the knot he left in me. He said one day I&#x2019;d tell our story back to him. But my words are wild country, and I don&#x2019;t have a map.<br> <br>I press my face to the plane window. On the island under us, Manhattan&#x2019;s holes look like lace. I look for the one where Baba is sleeping and try to remember how the story starts. My words tumble through the glass, falling to the earth.<br> <br><br> <br>AUGUST IN HOMS is hot and rainless. It&#x2019;s been three months since we moved to Syria, and Mama doesn&#x2019;t leave her tears on the pomegranates anymore. She doesn&#x2019;t leave them anywhere.<br> <br>Today, like every day, I look for the salt where I left my voice&#x2014;in the earth. I go out to the fig tree in Mama&#x2019;s garden, standing heavy with fruit just the way I imagined the fig Baba once had in his backyard. I press my nose to the fig&#x2019;s roots and breathe in. I&#x2019;m belly-down, stone heat in my ribs, my hand up to the knuckles in reddish dirt. I want the fig to carry a story back to Baba on the other side of the ocean. I lean in to whisper, brushing the roots with my upper lip. I taste purple air and oil.<br> <br>A yellow bird taps the ground, looking for worms. But the sea dried up here a long time ago, if it was ever here at all. Is Baba still lying where we left him, brown and stiff and dry as kindling? If I went back, would I have the big tears I should have had then, or is the sea dried up in me forever?<br> <br>I rub the smell of water out of the fig&#x2019;s bark. I&#x2019;ll tell Baba our story, and maybe I&#x2019;ll find my way back to that place where my voice went, and Baba and I won&#x2019;t be so alone. I ask the tree to take my story in its roots and send it down where it&#x2019;s dark, where Baba sleeps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Make sure he gets it,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Our favorite, about Rawiya and al-Idrisi. The one Baba told me every night. The one where they mapped the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>But the earth and the fig don&#x2019;t know the story like I do, so I tell it again. I start the way Baba always did: &#x201c;Everybody knows the story of Rawiya,&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;They just don&#x2019;t know they know it.&#x201d; And then the words come back like they had never left, like it had been me telling the story all along.<br> <br>Inside, Huda and Mama clank wooden bowls and porcelain. I forgot all about the special dinner for Abu Sayeed tonight. I might not be able to finish the story before Mama calls me in to help, her voice all red edges.<br> <br>I press my nose to the ground and promise the fig I&#x2019;ll find a way to finish. &#x201c;No matter where I am,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put my story in the ground and the water. Then it&#x2019;ll get to Baba, and it&#x2019;ll get to you too.&#x201d;<br> <br>I imagine the vibrations of my voice traveling thousands of miles, cracking through the planet&#x2019;s crust, between the tectonic plates we learned about in science class last winter, burrowing into the dark where everything sleeps, where the world is all colors at once, where nobody dies.<br> <br>I start again.<br> <br><br> <br>EVERYBODY KNOWS THE story of Rawiya. They just don&#x2019;t know they know it.<br> <br>Once there was and was not a poor widow&#x2019;s daughter named Rawiya whose family was slowly starving. Rawiya&#x2019;s village, Benz�, lay by the sea in Ceuta&#x2014;a city in modern-day Spain, a tiny district on an African peninsula that sticks into the Strait of Gibraltar.<br> <br>Rawiya dreamed of seeing the world, but she and her mother could barely afford couscous, even with the money Rawiya&#x2019;s brother, Salim, brought home from his sea voyages. Rawiya tried to be content with her embroidery and her quiet life with her mother, but she was restless. She loved to ride up and down the hills and through the olive grove atop her beloved horse, Bauza, and dream of adventures. She wanted to go out and seek her fortune, to save her mother from a life of eating barley-flour porridge in their plaster house under the stony face of Jebel Musa, watching the shore for her brother&#x2019;s ship.<br> <br>When she finally decided to leave home at sixteen, all Rawiya had to take with her was her sling. Her father had made it for her when she was a little girl throwing rocks at dragonflies, and she wouldn&#x2019;t leave it behind. She packed it in her leather bag and saddled Bauza by the fig tree next to her mother&#x2019;s house.<br> <br>Now Rawiya was afraid to tell her mother how long she&#x2019;d be gone, thinking she might try and stop her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only going to the market in Fes,&#x201d; Rawiya said, &#x201c;to sell my embroidery.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Rawiya&#x2019;s mother frowned and asked her to promise to be careful. The wind came strong off the strait that day, rattling through her mother&#x2019;s scarf and the hem of her skirt.<br> <br>Rawiya had wrapped a red cloth around her face and neck, hiding her new-cut hair. She told her mother, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t stay longer than I have to.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t want her mother to know she was thinking of the story she&#x2019;d heard many times&#x2014;the story of the legendary mapmaker who came to the market in Fes once a year.<br> <br>The wind opened and closed Rawiya&#x2019;s scarf like a lung. The painful thought struck her that she did not know how long she would be gone.<br> <br>Mistaking her daughter&#x2019;s sadness for nerves, Rawiya&#x2019;s mother smiled. She produced a misbaha of wooden beads from her pocket and set it in Rawiya&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;My own mother gave me these prayer beads when I was a girl,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;God willing, they will comfort you while you are away.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rawiya hugged her mother fiercely and told her she loved her, trying to commit her smell to memory. Then she climbed into Bauza&#x2019;s saddle, and he clicked his teeth against his bit.<br> <br>Rawiya&#x2019;s mother smiled at the sea. She had once traveled to Fes, and she hadn&#x2019;t forgotten the journey. She said to her daughter, &#x201c;Every place you go becomes a part of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But none more so than home.&#x201d; Rawiya meant this more than anything else she&#x2019;d said. And then Rawiya of Benz� nudged her horse until he turned toward the inland road, past the high peaks and fertile plains of the mountainous Rif where the Berbers lived, toward the Atlas Mountains and the teeming markets of Fes beckoning from the south.<br> <br>The trade road wound through limestone hills and green plains of barley and almond trees. For ten days, Rawiya and Bauza picked their way along the winding road ground flat by travelers&#x2019; shoes. Rawiya reminded herself of her plan: to find the legendary mapmaker, Abu Abd Allah Muhammad al-Idrisi. She planned to become his apprentice, pretending to be a merchant&#x2019;s son, and make her fortune. She would give a fake name&#x2014;Rami, meaning &#x201c;the one who throws the arrow.&#x201d; A good, strong name, she told herself.<br> <br>Rawiya and Bauza crossed the green hills that separated the curved elbow of the Rif from the Atlas Mountains. They climbed high slopes topped by cedar forests and cork oak trees where monkeys rustled the branches. They curved down through valleys spread with yellow wildflowers.<br> <br>The Atlas Mountains were the stronghold of the Almohads, a Berber dynasty seeking to conquer all of the Maghreb, the northern lands of Africa to the west of Egypt. Here, in their lands, every sound made Rawiya uneasy, even the snuffling of wild boar and the echoes of Bauza&#x2019;s hooves on the limestone cliffs. At night, she heard the distant sounds of instruments and singing and found it hard to sleep. She thought of the stories she had heard as a child&#x2014;tales of a menacing bird big enough to carry off elephants, legends of deadly valleys filled with giant emerald-scaled snakes.<br> <br>Finally, Rawiya and Bauza came upon a walled city in a valley. Caravans of merchants from the Sahara and from Marrakesh spilled onto the grassy plain dotted by eucalyptus trees. The green rope of the Fes River split the city in two. The folded chins of the High Atlas cast long shadows.<br> <br>Inside the city gates, Bauza trotted between plaster houses painted shades of rose and saffron, green-crowned minarets, and gilded window arches. Rawiya was dazzled by jade roofs and jacaranda trees blooming the color of purple lightning. In the Medina, merchants sat cross-kneed behind huge baskets of spices and grains. The tapestry of colors caught Rawiya&#x2019;s eye: the frosted indigo of ripe figs, rust-red paprika. Hanging lanterns of wrought metal and colored glass sent tiny petals of light that clung to shadowed alleyways. Children pattered through the streets, smelling of tanned leather and spices.<br> <br>Rawiya guided Bauza toward the center of the Medina, where she hoped to find the mapmaker. Dust from the streets painted Bauza&#x2019;s hooves. In the heat of the day, the shade of carved stone and mosaic tile felt cool, refreshing. The cries of merchants and spice vendors deafened Rawiya. The air was thick with sweat and oil, the musk of horses and camels and men, the bite of pomegranates, the sugar-song of dates.<br> <br>Rawiya searched among the merchants and travelers, interrupting sales of spices and perfumes and salt, asking about a man who traveled weighted down by leather-bound scrolls and parchment-paper sketches of the places he&#x2019;d been, a man who had sailed the Mediterranean. No one knew where to find him.<br> <br>Rawiya was about to give up when she heard a voice: &#x201c;I know the person you seek.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and saw a man stooped in front of a camel tied to an olive tree. He sat in a small courtyard off the Medina, his white turban wrapped close around his head, his leather shoes and robe coated in a sheen of travel dust. He beckoned her closer.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know the mapmaker?&#x201d; Rawiya stepped into the courtyard.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want with him?&#x201d; The man had a short, dark beard, and his eyes as he studied her were polished obsidian.<br> <br>Rawiya added up her words. &#x201c;I am a merchant&#x2019;s son,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I wish to offer my services to the mapmaker. I wish to learn the craft and earn a living.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man smiled, catlike. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you where to find him if you can answer three riddles. Do you accept?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rawiya nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;The first riddle,&#x201d; the man said, &#x201c;is this.&#x201d; And he said:<br> <br>Who is the woman who lives forever,<br> <br>Who tires never,<br> <br>Who has eyes in all places<br> <br>and a thousand faces?<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me think.&#x201d; Rawiya patted Bauza&#x2019;s neck. Hunger and heat had made her light-headed, and the mention of a woman made her think of her mother. Rawiya wondered what her mother was doing&#x2014;probably watching the sea for Salim. It had been so long since she&#x2019;d had Baba to watch the water with her, to walk with her through the olive grove. Rawiya remembered when she was small, how Baba had told her of the sea, that shape-shifting woman who never died&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;The sea,&#x201d; Rawiya cried. &#x201c;She lives forever, always changing her moods. The sea has a thousand faces.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man laughed. &#x201c;Very good.&#x201d; And he continued with the second riddle:<br> <br>What is the map you take with you<br> <br>everywhere you go&#x2014;<br> <br>the map that guides, sustains you<br> <br>through field and sun and snow?<br> <br>...</p><h2>Grace Works</h2><p>Ever since Adam and Eve were escorted out of the garden, mankind has sought a way to regain God&#39;s acceptance-often through outward religion.

Quetzalcoatl goes, and when the Sun and his musical servants ignore him, he becomes so angry that he stirs up a violent storm and carries the musicians back with him. The world comes to life as they wander around, spreading their melodies everywhere. This retelling is based on a poem from a 16th-century Nahua (Aztec) manuscript. In a prefatory note, Hal Ober details modifications he made in order to maintain a logical order of events and to animate the story through dialogue. Despite this, the tale never comes to life. The text is wordy, the language is stiff, and it never quite flows. The gods' motivation for bringing music to Earth is not convincing, and its inherent beauty is overshadowed by the violence of its capture. The vibrant, cutout oil pastel drawings in vivid blues, yellows, and greens are full of Aztec and Mayan imagery and design elements. Carol Ober's technique involves moving the cutouts around on a stage, creating a three-dimensional diorama effect. There is real drama in the art. Yet, while the pictures are striking, some of them have a static look, unfortunately mirroring the lack of fluidity in the text. For a more balanced adaptation of an ancient Mexican tale about music, try the bilingual version of the Mayan legend Song of the Chirimia/La Musica de la Chirimia (Carolrhoda, 1992) by Jane Volkmer.<br><i>Lauren Mayer, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sweet Revenge: One Man&#39;s LoveWith No Regrets</h2><p><br><br><strong>Two classic tales of dangerous secrets and the love that overcomes them from #1 <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author Lisa Jackson.</strong><br><br><em>One Man's Love</em><br><br>Stacey Monroe made it a rule not to get personally involved with any of her patients&#x2014;and certainly not with their fathers!

He called to his daughter through the screen door, which he hadn't bothered to close. "Cindy, wait for me in the yard! I'll be right there." With an impatient curse, he turned his attention to the phone. "Hello?" he called into the mouthpiece, but there was no answer. "Is someone there?" Irritation gave way to dread. His heart began to pound irregularly, and he tried to listen for any sound that would give away the caller. "Hello? Who is this?" he demanded. Nothing.<br><br>"Hello! Can you hear me?" He waited, his palms beginning to sweat. "Dammit!" Slamming the receiver back into the cradle, he hurried out of the cottage to find that his daughter hadn't bothered to wait for him. "Cindy?"<br><br><em>Maybe the phone call was a trap.</em><br><br>Someone could have been watching the house, called from a remote phone and snatched Cindy. His jaw tightened; a quea-siness gripped his gut. "Cindy!" He glanced quickly around the yard, but she wasn't anywhere to be seen.<br><br>"Get a hold of yourself. No one knows you're here&#x2014;only Barbara," he muttered as he ran to the steps leading down to the beach and spotted his child on the white sand.<br><br>"Thank God," he whispered, leaning against the sun-bleached rail. His shoulders slumped in relief, and he squinted into the late afternoon sun.<br><br>Not far from Cindy was the woman he had hoped to meet for several days, a woman who might be able to help him, a woman by the name of Anastasia Monroe.<br><br>Nathan had studied her from a distance, noting the wild disarray of the honey-colored hair that tumbled down her back in soft curls, the smooth slope of her shoulders and the gentle curves of her body, undisguised by her casual clothes.<br><br>For the past three days he'd been watching her, wondering how to approach her and, unfortunately, he'd fantasized about her as well, sometimes lying awake at night until all hours of the morning just thinking about her and wondering why she affected him so strongly and deeply. He'd imagined the way her skin would taste, the widening of her eyes as he kissed her, the feel of her lips and the warmth of her body heated with passion. Why? <em>The forbidden fruit, </em>he'd rationalized.<br><br>Now as he watched her, the wind lifted her wild hair away from her face and wrapped her sundress around her slim legs.<br><br>He experienced the same seed of desire that had made his nights unbearable. "Dammit, Sloan, you're letting all this get to you and acting like some horny teenager to boot," he grumbled, but the dull ache of desire raced through his blood, firing a response in his loins just the same.<br><br>The woman walking on the beach, Anastasia Monroe, or Stacey as she preferred to be called, was the last woman in the world he could trust with his secret. To become involved with her would be the biggest mistake of his life. He kept reminding himself of those annoying facts as he descended the worn staircase.<br><br>The sand felt cool beneath her bare feet as Stacey walked near the ocean's edge, her eyes scanning the tide pools for various treasures that would inspire her young students. She spied a scurrying fiddler crab and carefully captured him with her fingers before dropping him into the bucket of water swinging from her left hand. "I'll make you a star," she promised with a slightly off center smile as the crab lifted his pincers threateningly.<br><br>Stacey laughed to herself. "Don't worry," she said. "I'll set you free in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime, fella, you're going to earn your keep."<br><br>She continued to walk along the rocky coast of the island as she studied the shimmering pools and squinted at the reflection of the sun on the water. Her feet were callused from two months of beachcombing, and she was so intent in her search of the tide pools that she barely noticed that the hem of her sundress was wet.<br><br>"Here we go," she murmured to herself, as she bent down again and this time retrieved a delicate salmon-colored starfish, examined it and dropped it into the oversized bucket.<br><br>The sun was warm against her back, and the breeze lifting the sun-bleached strands of hair from her face and shoulders felt good against the bare skin of her arms and legs. As most of the afternoon had already slipped away, Stacey decided it was time to hike back to her cottage near the school where she taught. Thinking of her students, she smiled. So many of them had come so far, overcome so many problems....<br><br>She stopped suddenly, and the water sloshed in the bucket as she saw the little girl, all alone on the deserted beach. The blond-headed child hadn't noticed her, so intent was she on digging in the sand. Stacey quickly glanced up and down the beach for the mother, aunt, older brother, babysitter or any other kind of guardian who was responsible for the tousle-headed little girl.<br><br>Concerned, Stacey walked up to the child. "Hi," she said with a cheery smile meant to disguise her confusion.<br><br>No response. The girl kept right on digging.<br><br>"What's your name?" Stacey persisted while bending on one knee a few feet from the industrious little excavator.<br><br>The child ignored her and continued to scoop up wet sand with a bright red shovel.<br><br>Stacey tried again. "Where's your mommy?"<br><br>The shovel stopped, and the child lifted her head to regard Stacey with large blue eyes that darkened a little. "Don't got a mommy," she said.<br><br>Stacey's heart twisted for the beguiling little girl, though she was slightly suspicious of the story. The child was dressed in bright pink shorts and a white ruffled midriff blouse. Identical pink clips kept the gold ringlets out of her eyes. The little girl was no waif. Someone obviously cared about her. So where was the mother?<br><br>Again, almost angrily this time, she scanned the beach. Then she noticed the man, a solitary figure running toward her and the child. He was tall and ran with the easy gait of an athlete. His shoulders were wide, but the rest of his body was lean, and he was dressed in faded jeans and a lightweight sweater with the sleeves bunched over his forearms. His worried eyes were deep set, guarded by thick, black brows as they focused upon the child. His square jaw was set rigidly with concern, but the expression on his angular features was a trained calm&#x2014;the kind that hinted at an inner wariness&#x2014; and belied any outward sign of emotion.<br><br>"Hello," Stacey said, trying to hide her anger as she straightened and offered a forced smile. "Is this your little girl?"<br><br>With obvious relief softening his worried expression, the man stopped near the child and reached down to pick her up. "Yes," he admitted. "This is Cindy." He glanced fondly at the girl and kissed her wild blond curls. "Can you say hello to Miss&#x2014;"<br><br>"Monroe. Stacey Monroe." <em>Dear Lord, didn't he realize how dangerous it was for a child to play unattended near the surf? </em>She wiped her sandy palm on the folds of her skirt before extending her hand toward the stranger.<br><br>His fingers wrapped around her hand in a gesture of genuine warmth. "Nathan Sloan." A trace of a smile flashed across his tanned face giving his angular features just a hint of boyish charm that was in direct conflict with the cynical creases near the corners of his intense blue eyes.<br><br>"It's good to know that <em>someone </em>was looking after Cindy," Stacey said, unable to hide the edge of her voice until she looked again at the child. "And it was nice to meet you."<br><br>There was still no response from the little girl. She stared out to sea as if mesmerized, and Stacey began to understand why Cindy's father had let her wander onto the sand where Stacey had been beachcombing. It hadn't been an accident or an oversight on his part. In fact, he'd probably planned it! Stacey's jaw tightened and her eyes grew cold.<br><br>"She's...shy," Nathan said as if searching for a better word and Stacey lifted her gaze to meet a secret sadness in his gaze. He looked away and cleared his throat. "And she's also headstrong. We were just leaving the house when the phone rang and she ran off without me." He looked at his daughter in mock anger. "You know you're not supposed to come down here alone."<br><br>Cindy ignored her father's disapproval and slid out of his arms. She began digging once again and acted as if the adults weren't present. Stacey knew there was more to Cindy's behavior than timidity. Having worked with disturbed children for eight years, Stacey was able to see the evidence of stress in the small round face.<br><br>This Mr. Sloan had probably expected to meet Stacey on the beach. His child hadn't just happened to wander down to the beach alone. Nathan Sloan had arranged it. Stacey couldn't help her anger; the man had <em>used </em>his child, put Cindy in danger, to meet Stacey.<br><br>As if reading Stacey's mind, Nathan sighed. "She's difficult to handle sometimes," he said, rubbing his chin and staring at his little girl. Cindy had begun to wander down the beach and was out of earshot.<br><br>"Probably inherited, I'd guess."<br><br>Nathan frowned and his blue eyes, when he looked up, had taken on a seductive hue.<br><br>"Look, Mr. Sloan. I know what's going on here," she said angrily, ignoring his smoldering gaze. "You're trying to enroll Cindy in the private school&#x2014;that's why you're here&#x2014;on Sanctity Island. Right?"<br><br>Nathan's jaw became rigid, but he didn't deny what was so patently obvious. He nodded tightly as he looked at his child.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And you hoped that I'd run into Cindy this afternoon." "I'd hoped," he admitted.<br><br>"And it didn't matter that it was dangerous to Cindy. She could have wandered out in the ocean before I saw her!"<br><br>Nathan's head snapped up. "No way. I was watching her&#x2014; from over there." He cocked his head in the direction of the stairs. "I'll admit that she did get ahead of me when the phone rang. But I didn't plan to have her come down to the beach alone." His expression tightened. "I would never do anything that might put Cindy in any kind of danger." The wariness in his tone and the guarded look he gave her convinced Stacey.<br><br>She crossed her arms over her chest and tried to control her temper. "So why didn't you come into the school?"<br><br>"I did. Last week. You weren't in. I didn't want to leave a message because I wanted to meet with you in person."<br><br>"So you followed me to the beach." she accused.<br><br><em>More times than you'll ever know, </em>he thought. Chuckling at her irritation, he smiled and once again his face took on a certain boyish charm that touched a forbidden part of her heart. "Nothing that sinister. <em>Really. </em>I just knew that you walked on this stretch in the afternoons and well, I took a chance that you'd be here."<br><br>He seemed honest; the concern he felt for his child appeared genuine. But something about his story just didn't ring true. Telling herself she was entirely too suspicious, she asked, "Why did you want me to meet Cindy?"<br><br>"Because of her behavior," he admitted. The lines near his mouth deepened. "Cindy became a different person sometime after her mother's death, just over a year ago. At first I thought her reaction was normal. At least I wanted to believe it. To convince myself, I rationalized that even small children grieve. But..." He frowned and rubbed the back of his neck. "But I'm afraid it's more than simple grief. She seems to be getting worse instead of better. She's regressed to the point that sometimes I need help reaching her." Looking past the cresting waves he sighed wearily. "As I said, I visited the school, but the receptionist told me that Oceancrest wasn't accepting any more children and I'd have to put her on a waiting list."<br><br>"That's what I understand," Stacey admitted, frowning a little as she studied the child. "You have to realize that I don't make those decisions&#x2014;I'm just a teacher."<br><br>"Not just a teacher," Nathan interrupted. "The best specialist in this part of the country. You've worked with the Edwards Clinic in Boston and did research for Florida State University before you moved here two years ago. From everything I've read, you're the best child psychologist in the Pacific Northwest."<br><br>"I don't know about that," Stacey said, blushing as she laughed quietly and shook her head. "I'd like to know where you got your information. It sounds like you've been talking to my aunt."<br><br>"It's the truth," he said bluntly.<br><br>Stacey held up her hand in protest. "Look, I'm flattered, but I don't think I deserve all the accolades. In fact, I'm sure I don't!"<br><br>"Don't sell yourself short."<br><br>"Never," she said, laughing.<br><br>"I didn't talk to your aunt. You've earned your reputation."<br><br>She blushed a little under his compliment and the intensity of his erotic eyes. "Look, I'm just a teacher." "And a damned good one."<br><br>Stacey avoided his gaze and studied Cindy as the cherubic-looking child returned to play near her father. Staying within Nathan's reach, Cindy examined a broken shell.<br><br>"Some people would disagree with your opinion," Stacey thought aloud, her heart wrenching painfully when she remembered Daniel Brown. How dearly she had loved that little boy.... Clearing her throat and ignoring Nathan's scrutinizing gaze, Stacey pushed aside the anguish and scandal of the past. "We only have one class for preschoolers." Stacey tilted her head upward to meet Nathan's bold stare.<br><br>"And you're the teacher."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Nathan gestured in frustration before making a sound of disgust. His muscles flexed with the strain of trusting a woman he barely knew, a woman with beautiful sun-streaked hair and intelligent hazel eyes that seemed to flicker between green and gold. "Look, I don't like asking for anyone's help," he admitted. "And I'm not crazy about having to plead my case to a woman I don't even know, but, in all honesty, I'm at the end of my rope."<br><br>"And you don't like it."<br><br>His eyes glinted with a savagery born of desperation. "I like to be in control, Miss Monroe.

Behind the thick dark brows, deep-set blue eyes and angular features was a very proud man. Her spine prickled when she looked into his eyes, and she imagined for a moment that he was lying to her, guarding a secret.<br><br>"I'm only asking that you work with Cindy for her sake," he pressed. "She needs you." He shifted his gaze to his daughter. "Cindy, would you like to go to Miss Monroe's school?"<br><br>The child ignored him.<br><br>"Cindy?"<br><br>Again, no response. If anything, Cindy was more remote than ever, to the point that she blocked out her father.

James 'Max' Maxted, former Great War flying ace, returns to the trail of murder, treachery and half-buried secrets he set out on in <i>The Ways of the World</i>. He left Paris after avenging the murder of his father, Sir Henry Maxted, a senior member of the British delegation to the post-war peace conference. But he was convinced there was more -- much more -- to be discovered about what Sir Henry had been trying to accomplish. And he suspected elusive German spymaster Fritz Lemmer knew the truth of it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, enlisted under false colours in Lemmer's service but with his loyalty pledged to the British Secret Service, Max sets out on his first -- and possibly last -- mission for Lemmer. It takes him to the far north of Scotland -- to the Orkney Isles, where the German High Seas Fleet has been impounded in Scapa Flow, its fate to be decided at the conference-table in Paris. Max has been sent to recover a document held aboard one of the German ships. What that document contains forces him to break cover sooner than he would have wished and to embark on a desperate race south, towards London, with information that could destroy Lemmer -- if Max, as seems unlikely, lives to deliver it.</p><p>ROBERT GODDARD was born in Hampshire and read History at Cambridge.

Progressive programs about ethnic history, postwar urban planning, and civil rights have helped make historic preservation and public history meaningful. <i>The Battles of Germantown </i>considers what these efforts can tell us about public history&#x2019;s practice and purpose in the United States. &nbsp;</p><p>Author David Young, a neighborhood resident who worked at Germantown historic sites for decades, uses his practitioner&#x2019;s perspective to give examples of what he calls &#x201c;effective public history.&#x201d; <i>The Battles of Germantown </i>shows how the region celebrated &#x201c;Negro Achievement Week&#x201d; in 1928 and, for example, how social history research proved that the neighborhood&#x2019;s Johnson House was a station on the Underground Railroad. These encounters have useful implications for addressing questions of race, history, and memory, as well as issues of urban planning and economic revitalization.&nbsp;</p><p>Germantown&#x2019;s historic sites use public history and provide leadership to motivate residents in an area challenged by job loss, population change, and institutional inertia. <i>The Battles of Germantown</i> illustrates how understanding and engaging with the past can benefit communities today.</p></p><p><p><b>David W.

Officially they blame a prophecy that no bridge will stand over the river without human sacrifice to the water spirits. So the builders immure a villager and the bridge gets built. A Balkan parable by the author of The Pyramid.</p><p>The year: 1377. The place: the Balkan peninsula. Here in Ismail Kadare's novel, <i>The Three-Arched Bridge</i>, an Albanian monk chronicles the events surrounding the construction of a bridge across a great river known as Ujana e Keqe, or "Wicked Waters." If successful in their endeavor, the bridge-builders will challenge a monopoly on water transportation known simply as "Boats and Rafts." The story itself parallels developments in modern-day Eastern Europe, with the bridge emblematic of a disintegrating economic and political order: just as mysterious cracks in the span's masonry endanger the structure and cast the local community into a morass of uncertainty, superstition, and murder, so the fast-changing conditions in the 14th-century Balkan peninsula threaten to overwhelm the stability of life there. <p> Dark as the story itself is, Mr. Kadare's prose, skillfully translated from the Albanian by John Hodgson, is elegant, witty, and deft. And with so many twists and turns in its carefully constructed plot, this political parable keeps the reader's interest to the very end.</p>Balkan peninsula is a bridge between cultures. On one side lies the flotsam of the receding Byzantine empire, an unruly alliance whose peoples quarrel in half a dozen tongues; on the other, the encroaching hordes of Ottoman Turkey. On the banks of a river somewhere in between these powers, another bridge is rising. And in telling its story, Albania's greatest living writer creates what is at once a magnificently realized historical novel and a chilling parable of the new barbarism that has swept the Balkans.<br><br>When mysterious acts of sabotage halt construction of the three-arched bridge, a man suspected of the crimes is discovered walled up in the foundation, with only his head protruding from the stone. Is his death meant to deter other saboteurs or to appease the spirits of the river? Does it fulfill an ancient prophecy or predict further bloodshed? Superbly written, resonant with menace and sorrow, <i>The Three-Arched Bridge</i> is as powerful an evocation of a vanished world as &amp;</p><h2>Earth (POCKET GENIUS)</h2><p>The prefect sized books for backpacks, DK's Pocket Genius series is bright, inviting, concise, and punchy &#x20ac;&#x201d; the ideal source for reference.

Julie Bowe takes on the tough questions about what it means to be honest, to be a good friend, and to be a family, and offers answers that, while not always easy, are always true."&#x2014;Linda Urban, author of <i>Weekends with Max</i> and <i>A Crooked Kind of Perfect</i><br><br>"Bowe so masterfully took me inside the head and heart of Wren Jo Byrd that I felt like a ten year old again&#x2014;and loved every minute."&#x2014;Barbara O'Connor, author of <i>How to Steal a Dog</i><br>It's the start of a new school year and Wren Jo Byrd is worried that everyone will find out her parents separated over the summer. No one knows the truth, not even her best friend, Amber. When even her new teacher refers to her mom as <i>Mrs.</i> Byrd, Wren decides to keep their divorce a total secret. But something else changed over the summer: A new girl named Marianna moved to town and wants to be Amber's next bff. And because of her fib, Wren can't do anything about it. From take-out dinners with Mom to the tiny room she gets at Dad's new place, nothing is the same for Wren anymore. But while Marianna makes everything harder at first, Wren soon learns that Marianna once had to ask many of the same questions&#x2014;the big ones, as well as the little ones&#x2014;that Wren is asking now.<br><br>Set in Wisconsin, with wonderfully nuanced characters&#x2014;from the bossy new girl, who acts big but has a secret of her own, to the sporty girl who acts little and shy but who becomes an unexpected friend&#x2014;this is a book about much more than divorce.</p><p>Julie Bowe is a full-time author who knows how to strum a guitar, count to three in Danish (<i>en, to, tre!</i>), and had her first story published in fifth grade when she entered a contest in the local newspaper and won first place!

(Afterward, we hyperventilated for a while.)</p><p>� My parents gave me my own phone. Amber has the same one.</p><p>But all those changes seem little compared to the big change that happened over the summer. Dad moved out. When your parents decide to get a divorce, someone has to leave.</p><p>Now big things&#x2014;like meeting my new teacher, and finding my desk, and wondering if my friends are allowed to wear tinted lip gloss to school this year&#x2014;seem little. And little things&#x2014;like family photos disappearing from the refrigerator door, and not hearing Dad&#x2019;s truck pull into the driveway, and not smelling his spicy chili simmering on the stove&#x2014;seem big.</p><p>First, Dad lived at a hotel. Then he moved in with some friends. Now it&#x2019;s September and he&#x2019;s renting a cabin across the lake from our house. I mean, Mom&#x2019;s house. I mean, my house. I mean, I don&#x2019;t know what I mean.</p><p>Mom and Dad told me they were getting a divorce on the first day of summer vacation, which used to be my favorite day of the year. I was eating a bowl of fruity cereal. I remember because as soon as they said that word&#x2014;divorce&#x2014;I dribbled pink milk down the front of my sparkly koala bear shirt. The one I got when Amber invited me to spend spring break at a resort with her family. We both got the same shirt and pretended we were sisters. Mom and Dad kept talking, but I stopped listening and ran to the bathroom and threw up even though I didn&#x2019;t have the flu or anything. Fruity cereal does not taste good on its way out of your stomach, but it&#x2019;s still just as bright.</p><p>Mom and Dad told me that everything would be okay, and nothing was my fault, and they both loved me very much.</p><p>But nothing was okay.</p><p>I&#x2019;m part of this family too. I should get a say in the big stuff.</p><p>My mom is the head librarian at the Oak Hill Public Library, and she&#x2019;s always telling me to look things up for myself. I looked up the word divorce in the big, fat dictionary that sits on a fancy pedestal at the back of her library. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;d never heard that word before. I mean, I watch TV. But I didn&#x2019;t really know what it meant, or exactly how to spell it. After a few tries, I found it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Davorse</p><p>Devorce</p><p>Divorce</p><p>� A complete separation between two things</p><p>� To dissolve a marriage</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then I looked up the word dissolve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dissolve</p><p>� To break up</p><p>� To melt</p><p>� To disappear</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you ask me, dissolve is a dumb word for divorce because it doesn&#x2019;t make things melt and disappear like ice cream or cotton candy. Divorce makes everything hard and sour, like a jawbreaker you have to keep hidden in your cheek so it doesn&#x2019;t get stuck in your throat.</p><p>After Dad started looking for a place to rent, and taught me how to use my new phone, Mom hauled a big suitcase down from the attic and told me I had to go stay with my grandparents in the city while she and Dad had lawyer meetings and divided up all their stuff.</p><p>I love G-ma and G-pa, but going away when everything was falling apart felt like the biggest mistake in the world. But I still had to go.</p><p>I missed Amber&#x2019;s birthday.</p><p>And swimming lessons.</p><p>And fireworks over Pickerel Lake.</p><p>And Phoebe Bartlett&#x2019;s Fourth of July cookout.</p><p>And the summer reading party at the library.</p><p>Mom gave me hardly any warning, so there wasn&#x2019;t even time to say good-bye to anyone. I saw my school friends Phoebe and Eleanor riding their bikes when Mom was driving me to my grandparents&#x2019; house. They were wearing swimsuits and flip-flops, with beach towels around their necks, so I knew they were on their way to the pool. Amber was probably meeting them there because we are all friends. I almost waved to them, but then I thought, What if Mom stops so I can talk to them? How can I tell my friends I&#x2019;m going away because my mom and dad are getting divorced?</p><p>So I scrunched down in my seat as Mom drove past.</p><p>Amber sent me texts, but I didn&#x2019;t know how to answer. So I didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>When I finally got to come home, Dad&#x2019;s desk was gone. So was his recliner. There were gaps on our bookshelf, like missing teeth. His lucky baseball cap wasn&#x2019;t hanging on the hook by the back door, and none of his clothes were in the laundry. My favorite goofy picture of us&#x2014;the one Mom took of him and me at the water park when I was finally big enough to go on the logjam ride&#x2014;was nowhere. I guess it was Dad&#x2019;s favorite picture too.</p><p>Last night, Mom wrote a reminder and stuck it to the fridge with a smiley face magnet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wren&#x2019;s Weekly Schedule</p><p>Monday&#x2013;Thursday:&nbsp; Meet Mom at the library after school.</p><p>Friday:&nbsp; Ride Bus #5 to your dad&#x2019;s place.</p><p>Saturday&#x2013;Sunday:&nbsp; Stay with your dad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I walk over to the fridge and turn the smiley face magnet upside down.</p><p>Mom already bought me another toothbrush, extra hair bands, and new pajamas. She packed them in the cinch sack I use for sleepovers. Before this summer, Amber and I had sleepovers practically every weekend. Her family is big and loud, but it never feels crowded there. Not like my house, which sometimes feels crowded even though only three people live here. I mean, two people now. Is two even enough for a family?</p><p>&#x201c;Chop-chop, Wren,&#x201d; Mom says, taking a slice of pizza from the take-out box on the kitchen counter. &#x201c;Family Night starts in fifteen minutes. I&#x2019;ve got to make a couple phone calls, then we&#x2019;ll head over to school.&#x201d; She checks her phone for messages.</p><p>&#x201c;What about Dad?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming with us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I already told you, Wren,&#x201d; Mom says, glancing up as she scrolls. &#x201c;I gave him your schedule. He can meet us there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But why can&#x2019;t he come here first? There&#x2019;s lots of pizza. He&#x2019;s probably hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not hungry,&#x201d; Mom says.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;Have you talked to him?&#x201d;</p><p>Mom sighs and clicks off her screen. &#x201c;No, Wren. But I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s eating supper at his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cabin. Now finish eating. We&#x2019;re running late.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom heads into the living room with her phone to her ear.</p><p>I push the pizza box away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mew? Meew?&#x201d; Shakespeare pitter-patters across the kitchen floor and rubs a figure eight around my ankles. I pick him up and stroke his pussy-willow-white fur. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not hungry,&#x201d; I reply to my cat. &#x201c;Yes, my stomach feels icky again.&#x201d;</p><p>When I hear Mom&#x2019;s voice a moment later, I let myself hope that it&#x2019;s Dad she&#x2019;s talking to. &#x201c;Maybe she decided to call him,&#x201d; I whisper to Shakespeare. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s still time for him to stop by. We can go together.&#x201d;</p><p>But then I hear Mom say big words like interrogatories and financial portfolios and equalization of investments, so I know it&#x2019;s just her lawyer again. They never use little words when they talk.</p><p>Shakespeare purrs and licks my cheek. His tongue feels as scratchy as Dad&#x2019;s whiskers used to feel at the end of the day.</p><p>Shakespeare meows again, and I give him a piece of pepperoni. It&#x2019;s against our family rules to feed him from the table. But I&#x2019;m not eating at the table. I&#x2019;m at the kitchen counter. And there&#x2019;s no real family here anymore anyway. It&#x2019;s just me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p><b>What&#x2019;s a Diva?<br>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As we head out the door for Family Night, I ask Mom if I can bring Shakespeare along.</p><p>&#x201c;No, Wren,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Family Night is no place for a cat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he can stay in the car until we&#x2019;re done. I&#x2019;ll put him in his carrier with some toys. Please? Can I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wren, I gave you my answer.&#x201d; Mom takes a little mirror and a lipstick from her purse and puts some on. She checks her reflection, then sighs like she isn&#x2019;t crazy about what she sees.</p><p>&#x201c;But why can&#x2019;t Shakespeare come?&#x201d; I persist. &#x201c;If Dad were here, he wouldn&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your dad isn&#x2019;t here,&#x201d; Mom replies, snapping the clasp on her purse. &#x201c;Now, chop-chop or we&#x2019;ll be late.&#x201d; She picks up her keys and opens the back door. &#x201c;Grab a jacket, it&#x2019;s getting chilly.&#x201d;</p><p>Mom heads out.</p><p>I stomp behind her, leaving Shakespeare and my jacket at home.</p><p>On the way to my school, I call Amber. I&#x2019;ve been texting her since I got back, but she hasn&#x2019;t answered me. I never called Amber from G-ma and G-pa&#x2019;s. Not once. Amber hates crying. I did a lot of crying over the summer.</p><p>I was hoping we could meet our new teacher together. We wanted Mr. Ortega because he&#x2019;s super-nice and wears funny ties and has an old-time popcorn machine in his classroom for Friday after-noon movies. But Amber, Phoebe, Eleanor, and I got Ms. Little instead. Mom showed me the class list that came in the mail when I was gone. Ms. Little is brand-new, so I don&#x2019;t know if she&#x2019;s nice or funny or if she even likes popcorn. At least I get to be with my friends.</p><p>Finally, on the fifth ring, Amber answers her phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, it&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you get my messages?&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a pause, then Amber says, &#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hi. Yes, I got them. I was too busy to answer. You know how it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amber, I&#x2019;m so sorry I didn&#x2019;t tell you I was going away. I was super-sad to miss your birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not sad enough to call me or send a card,&#x201d; she says coolly.</p><p>&#x201c;I started to text you a bunch of times&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every-thing has been crazy lately&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2014;&#x201d; But I can&#x2019;t talk about my messed-up family when Mom is in the car. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how was everything while I was gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It. Was. Excellent,&#x201d; Amber replies. &#x201c;Except I am So. Bummed. I don&#x2019;t want school to start! Marianna and I went swimming Ev-Ree Day.&#x201d;</p><p>I frown into my phone. &#x201c;Why are you talking like a robot? Who is Marianna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is how I talk now, Wren,&#x201d; Amber says, like she bought a new voice when she did her school shopping. &#x201c;Marianna moved to Oak Hill this summer. She is the coolest girl Ev-Er. A total Dee-Va.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not exactly sure what a diva is, but I think it has something to do with opera. Maybe the new girl likes to sing?</p><p>Amber starts gushing more details about Marianna.&nbsp;&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. moved here from Seattle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gobs of friends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tons of cool clothes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I half listen as I take the phone away from my ear and lean forward so I can see Mom from the backseat. She&#x2019;s clenching the steering wheel even though there is almost no traffic. I notice she isn&#x2019;t wearing her wedding ring anymore. &#x201c;Mom? What&#x2019;s a diva?&#x201d;</p><p>Mom turns down the radio a notch and glances over her shoulder. &#x201c;Look it up,&#x201d; she replies.</p><p>I sit back with a sigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Amber is still talking. &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and then Marianna double-dog dared me to hide some older boys&#x2019; beach towels in the bushes! Oh-Em-Gee! We were laughing hysterically when they couldn&#x2019;t find them and had to drip all the way home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I tap D-E-E-V-A into my phone&#x2019;s dictionary.

I wonder if the new girl lives in a castle.</p><p>&#x201c;O-Em-Gee!&#x201d; Amber&#x2019;s voice cuts through the hum of the car. &#x201c;Marianna just texted me! Later!&#x201d;</p><p>I press the phone to my ear again. &#x201c;Wait! I&#x2019;m almost at the school. Meet me by the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But Amber is gone.</p><p>As Mom pulls into the Oak Hill Elementary parking lot a minute later, I see Amber thumbing her phone while walking inside with her parents, and Ivory and Slate, her sister and brother. Ivory goes to the middle school next door. Slate is starting kindergarten.</p><p>Lots of other kids are arriving with their families too. Oak Hill is small, so I recognize most of them as I look across the lot. I see Bo and Ty from my class, walking inside. Sometimes I call them Bowtie because they are always together. Bo&#x2019;s dad holds the door open for his mom and Ty&#x2019;s parents. And there&#x2019;s Ruby Olson, tossing a foam football around with her brothers; and Noah, another boy from my class. The Olsons&#x2019; football bonks Noah&#x2019;s big sister on the head, so she hollers at them, and they all crack up.</p><p>The whole sidewalk is filling up with moms and dads walking together, and kids darting ahead, excited to show their families the way to their classrooms.</p><p>We get out of the car and I search around for Dad, but I don&#x2019;t see him anywhere. I don&#x2019;t see anyone who looks like a diva either.</p><p>I glance back at Mom. Her eyes look far away as she takes in all the families too. Then she shifts her purse to her shoulder and straightens her blazer. &#x201c;Chop-chop, Wren,&#x201d; she says, taking my hand. &#x201c;Time to meet your teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>Ms. Little is standing just outside our coatroom door, greeting everyone as Mom and I walk down the hallway. A bunch of people, including Amber and her family, are crowded around her, so I can&#x2019;t see exactly what she looks like. But I catch a glimpse of short, brownish hair, and a bubble-gum-pink blouse. As we get closer, I can see that Phoebe and Eleanor aren&#x2019;t here yet, but Bowtie, Noah, and another boy, Mitchell, are there. They are standing still and smiling sweetly, which is total make-believe from how they usually act. I crane my neck, looking up and down the hall. Still no Dad.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably just running late,&#x201d; Mom says, giving me a sideways glance. Sometimes she knows what I&#x2019;m thinking without me saying a word. &#x201c;You know how he loves to talk on and on with people.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad is a building contractor, which means he fixes lots of houses. Almost everyone in town knows him. He&#x2019;s always waving at people from his truck, or stopping at the caf� to chat with them over coffee. The way Mom says it, though, makes me wonder if Dad will be here at all. The lawyers decided Mom would be in charge of me during the week. Dad is in charge of me on the weekends. It&#x2019;s Tuesday today, so Mom is in charge.

Her nail polish sparkles too. So do her shiny bubble-gum-pink shoes.</p><p>School hasn&#x2019;t even started yet and already my teacher sparkles. I smile back at her. &#x201c;Is that a real diamond?&#x201d; I ask, looking at her eyebrow again.</p><p>Mom tenses next to me. &#x201c;Wren,&#x201d; she says, like my question is silly.&lt;...</p></p><h2>Lord&#39;s Prayer</h2><p>The Lord's Prayer<i>, </i>taught by Jesus Christ to his disciples, has been an enduring source of faith and inspiration. Heidi Holder gathers together all of God's creatures--the tiniest insect and the most delicate butterfly, the goldfinch and the salmon-crested cockatoo, the gentle deer and the powerful leopard--to illuminate the promise of the prayer and to celebrate the beauty of the world God created.<br>Ms. Holder's extraordinary paintings accompany the text of the Lord's Prayer as it appears in the 1928 edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Her detailed notes on the illustrations, included at the back, explain the traditional or personal significance of some of the plants and animals she has chosen to portray.</p><p><b>Heidi Holder </b>has previously illustrated <i>Aesop's Fables, Crows: An Old Rhyme, </i>and <i>Carmine the Crow. </i>She is a self-taught artist who lives and works in New York City.Grade 3 Up - An elegantly illustrated rendition of the prayer Jesus taught to his followers. Using the text from the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, the artist adorns each page with symbolic, carefully chosen creatures and plants, from butterflies, dogwood blossoms, and exotic birds to camels, a lamb, and a leopard. Each of the rich, luxurious spreads contains one line of graceful script and a softly hued illustration, all edged with decorative borders. The flora and fauna in each exquisite painting have personal or religious significance that is explained in an appended notes section. This inspiring picture book celebrates the beauty and power of nature as well as the comforting words of the Lord's Prayer, and is a more traditional interpretation than Tim Ladwig's more modern version (Eerdmans, 2004).<i> - Linda L.

The building at Krausenstrasse 17/18 in Berlin was seized by a German businessman with direct ties to the very top of the Nazi Party hierarchy and German Railways&#x2014;the state-owned organization that transported millions of Jews across Europe to the death camps.

She currently serves as co-chair of the Washington Jewish Film Festival and is a senior editor at Moment magazine, the largest independent Jewish magazine in North America.Dina Gold digs deep into her history and leaves no stone unturned in her riveting account of the struggle for restitution of the property taken from her family by the Nazis. This is a meticulous and finely written account of her struggle to seek belated justice for her mother, with all the twists and turns one would expect from a fictional detective story &#x2014; but it is all true. -- E.

It is an amazing story. -- Walter Laqueur, historian; political commentator; author of The Terrible Secret<br><br>The Holocaust&#x2014;the project of exterminating Europe&#x2019;s Jews--was an immense act of murder. It was also an immense act of theft. The murder was, of course, the incomparably greater crime. The dead could never be brought back to life. The ash from crematoria was dumped into rivers or spread across fields; the bodies shot into ravines decomposed in Europe&#x2019;s mutilated earth. Yet the stolen property&#x2014;of those who were murdered and the minority who escaped or otherwise survived&#x2014;was seized and passed on, first by the Nazis and then by the governments that followed, to new possessors, public and private. Some pretended to own that property; most knew its real origins; few were willing to part with it. This is the story of a single such property that, by indefatigable effort, was reclaimed, at least partly, two generations later. It&#x2019;s the story of the theft. But it&#x2019;s also, by inference, a small part of the story of the murder. And it&#x2019;s the story of a rare act of belated and incomplete, but symbolically resonant, historical justice. -- Walter Reich, Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Professor of International Affairs, Ethics and Human Behavior; former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</p><h2>The Angry Aztecs and the Incredible Incas</h2><p>The foulest facts about the people whose idea of fun was ripping out human hearts, and the gory details on the incredible empire that was brought down by 260 Spanish invaders and a few germs...</p><p></p><h2>Exploring the World: Geography for Travel Professionals (4th Edition)</h2><p>Exploring the World opens the world to you like no other geography course you have experienced.

His mother died very early in his life&#x2013;an event that propelled him into experiences that later influenced him to write. It was difficult for Myers' father to raise eight children alone, and eventually, a nearby couple, Herbert and Florence Dean, took in three-year old Walter and moved to Harlem, New York. "Harlem became my home and the place where my first impressions of the world were set," says Myers.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a child, Myers went to school in his neighborhood and attended bible school almost every day of the week. Myers had a speech impediment which made communicating difficult for him, and often found himself in fights, defending himself against kids who taunted him. After a while, one of this teachers suggested to his class that they could write something to read aloud. Young Myers began writing poetry to give voice to his thoughts and feelings, and at age sixteen, won a prize in an essay contest and a set of encyclopedias for a long narrative poem. Later, his father bought him a used typewriter, which he used to churn out a seemingly endless stream of stories.<br>&nbsp;<br>Along with the many things he was discovering about himself, Myers was also learning how to survive. One day he had the courage to break up a fight between three gang members and a kid who had just moved into the neighborhood. He became a marked man&#x2013;and felt his life was in danger.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, once, he was sitting in the tree in Morningside Park, across from the building he lived in, reading O'Neill's <i>Mourning Becomes Electra</i>, when some gang members spotted him and surrounded the tree. Myers jumped to the ground, flashed a stiletto in order to fend them off, and made a mad dash for his building. He escaped, but he never forgot the incident. Later he enlisted in the army, got married, had a child, went through a turbulent creative struggle, got divorced, got married again&#x2013;and during all of this, kept writing, whether his work pleased him or not.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Walter Dean Myers' life is not the story of a tormented, embittered artist. Rather it is the story of a gifted, complex person committed to sharing that gift with young readers. Myers' stories and novels paint a powerful picture of the pressures of growing up on big city streets. Yet, he emphasizes close relationships, trust, and personal growth.<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems that one of Myers' greatest struggles was to understand what type of writer he wanted to be. As the years passed and his books became more and more popular, Walter Dean Myers came to believe that his work filled a void for African American youths who yearned for positive reading experiences and role models. He frequently writes about children who share similar economic and ethnic situations with his own childhood. "But my situation as a parent did not mirror that of my childhood," he says. "While my parents were quite poor, my children are thoroughly entrenched in the middle class experience. To them African prints go well with designer jeans, pizzas go down easier to a reggae beat, and shopping malls are an unmistakable part of their culture." <br>&nbsp;<br>It is clear that Myers' understanding of both the world he was raised in and the world of his children allows him to bring an authority to his work that resonates with his young readers. It is one of many attributes that has made him one of the most important children's and young adult authors writing today. Among his many honors are two Newbery Honor books for <i>Scorpions </i>and<i> Somewhere in the Darkness</i>. He is also a two-time recipient of the Coretta Scott King Award for <i>Now Is Your Time!</i> and <i>Fallen Angels</i>. In addition, Myers has received the Margaret A. Edwards Award for his contribution to young adult literature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Myers' novel, <i>Darnell Rock Reporting</i>, is a warm and humorous story about thirteen-year-old Darnell Rock&#x2013;a boy who works on his school newspaper. The book is sure to appeal to reluctant readers. Myers' recent picture book, <i>How Mr. Monkey Saw the Whole World,</i> is a cautionary fable about a watchful monkey who sees that a greedy buzzard gets his comeuppance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Myer&#x2019;s recent work, <i>145th Street: Short Stories</i> (A <i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i> Honor Book) captures the heartbeat of one memorable block in Harlem, New York. These powerful, often gripping stories range from humor and celebration to terror and grief.<br>&nbsp;<br>Walter Dean Myers, the father of three grown children, lives with his wife in Jersey City, New Jersey.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>One of the things my father used to say was how his days were piling up on him. When I told him I didn&#x2019;t know what that meant, he said one day I would.<br><br> &#x201c;Right now,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you got your days filled up with playing and going to school. Then after a while you gonna start dreaming about this and that, and you gonna lay your days out in front of yourself like an imaginary road. That&#x2019;s what I did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then what happened?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Then they started piling up on me,&#x201d; he said. He looked away and didn&#x2019;t say anything else, and I knew the conversation was over. When he looked away like that, there wasn&#x2019;t any use to keep on talking. <br><br> After he split, I stayed around the house a lot. I did most of the things I was supposed to do, like making the school scene and helping out around the house. I got a little job at the Grant, a little run-down hotel, when I got to be sixteen. That was really okay. I could earn a few bucks, and I could crash there when my moms got on my back too much. By my senior year she was on my back just about all the time, too. Something had come up between us that put an edge on everything we did. It wasn&#x2019;t anything I could really lay out and say, &#x201c;Hey, there it is,&#x201d; as much as it was a feeling. I&#x2019;d be sitting in the kitchen eating and she&#x2019;d come in and make some remark about how late I was staying out or something, and I just wouldn&#x2019;t want to hear it. So I&#x2019;d finish eating as soon as I could and then bust over to the Grant to spend the night there and cool out.<br><br> When I thought about it, I knew it wasn&#x2019;t so much that I had changed, or even that she had changed, but the situation was different than it had been, and we couldn&#x2019;t talk about it. When I was younger, I used to tell myself I was going to do this or do that and I believed it. Now I didn&#x2019;t know. For a long time Moms hung on to that old stuff, about me going to college and making something of myself. When I would lay in bed at the Grant, waiting for the next day to roll around, I was also waiting for something to happen, something to change my life. It was like I was running in a marathon and suddenly forgot where the finish line was. But I knew I still had a place to get to, even if I couldn&#x2019;t see it, and I knew I was scared to stop running.<br> &nbsp;<br> All along, though, I had my game. My game was my fame, and I knew it was together. From the first time I played basketball in grade school I was good. I was good, but I was short then. Some of the older guys used to call me runt. &#x201c;You got a sweet game for a kid, runt,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d say.<br><br> I was always on the court practicing, trying to get my game more together. I used to imagine being the shortest guy in the NBA and scoring the winning basket in the championship.<br><br> Then, when I got to be fifteen, I started to grow. When my seventeenth birthday came around, I was six three. Now, my game was sweet when I was short, but when I got taller, it was really nice. I played ball just about every day for about three years straight until near the end of my senior year. Then, all of a sudden, I began to go through a whole lot of changes. I was feeling okay, but I just didn&#x2019;t want to do anything. I&#x2019;d sit around and try to decide what I wanted to do, and that would take an hour or so, and then, when I decided what I wanted to do, I still might not do it because I just didn&#x2019;t seem to have the energy. Then, to top things off, sometimes if I did really break out into a hustle and do something, it would get messed up. I wasn&#x2019;t sure it was me or if things just weren&#x2019;t going my way. The Scotch is a good example of what I mean. <br> &nbsp;<br> I had had some words with my moms after I had left a tea bag in the sink.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; she said with her hands on her hips. &#x201c;Your arm so bad off you can&#x2019;t reach over there and put the tea bag in the garbage?&#x201d;<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t say nothing.<br><br> &#x201c;You know that tea bag is going to leave a stain and you&#x2019;re not going to clean it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I'll put it in the garbage,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, no, Mr. Jackson,&#x201d; she said in this high voice. &#x201c;Please let your servant do it.&#x201d;<br><br> Then she snatched up the tea bag and put it in the garbage.<br><br> &#x201c;So why didn't you just do that in the first place?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Why didn't I do that in the first place?&#x201d; She bent over from the waist and looked up at me. &#x201c;Who do you think I am, boy? I'm your mother, not your servant!&#x201d;<br><br> I listened to that until she got tired of running it; then I split on over to the Grant. I couldn't believe all that flap over a tea bag. I was pretty mad by the time 1 got to the hotel. I got the keys and went up into one of the empty rooms on the third floor and just sat in the window. I looked over towards the liquor store to see if I could see the clock. I couldn't, and I started to turn away. But something wasn't right. &#x201c;When I looked again, I could see the guy that ran the store standing close up against the shelves, and the clerk was standing right next to him. It looked like there were two other guys in there, too. One of them was a guy who delivered liquor to the store, and the other guy I didn&#x2019;t recognize, but I saw he had his hand in his jacket pocket. That&#x2019;s when I realized the store was being held up. Now the truck with the booze to be delivered is outside in the street and the driver is inside being stuck up, which gave me an idea. I busted down the stairs and into the street. I look into the liquor store, and I see that the guy with his hand in his pocket and a third guy I hadn&#x2019;t seen from the window are making everybody go into the back. I go over to the truck, open the back, and there&#x2019;s a case of Johnnie Walker close enough to grab. I look around to see if anybody is checking me out, but the only people on the block are some kids. I cop the case of Scotch and hightail it back into the Grant and up to my room.<br><br> I figure I can get at least five dollars a bottle for the Scotch, and there are twelve bottles to a case. I&#x2019;m feeling pretty good about the whole thing by the time I get the case under the bed. I go back to the window. There&#x2019;s this young brother up on the truck, and I figure he&#x2019;s going to cop, too. But instead of copping a case of something like I did, he takes a padlock off the truck and throws it to another kid. This kid runs up to the liquor store and puts the padlock on the door.<br><br> One of the guys inside the store sees what is going on and runs over to the door, but it&#x2019;s too late. The kid has locked them all inside. Then about four or five other kids start unloading the truck. Mean� while, the guys inside the store are banging on the window and hopping up and down and stuff. By this time it seems that half of Harlem is in on the action. One wino opens a bottle and is in the middle of the street, directing traffic. It takes about ten minutes to unload the truck. The whole block turns into a big party. Finally the cats inside the store shoot out the window just as a police car comes around the corner. There are a few shots fired, but nobody gets hurt, and soon everything is back to normal except for the glass on the street.<br><br> It was funny to watch, but then I realized that everybody on the block had Scotch and everything else now, and I wouldn&#x2019;t get nothing for mine. Still, I figured I could lay with it until everybody had drank theirs up. But that was the way my luck was running-even things that looked sweet weren&#x2019;t working out right for me.<br><br> I got depressed about the whole thing. I sat in the window and watched the people down in the street having a good time, and I began to feel worse and worse.<br><br> I have a funny way of thinking-at least I think it&#x2019;s funny because I don&#x2019;t hear anybody else saying they think the way I do. What I do is to think things part of the way out, and then I put them aside and think them out some more later on. I had begun to think about what my father had said a long time ago about your days piling up on you, and as I sat in the window of the Grant, I began thinking about it again. It was beginning to make more sense to me.<br><br> School was going to be out in another five or six weeks, and then I was going to have to figure out something to do with myself. Before, I&#x2019;d spend the summer playing ball and waiting around until school started again, so that would take care of itself. But now that school was just about over for me, the days seemed different, and I had to figure out what I was going to do with them. I knew I didn&#x2019;t want to work at the Grant all the time. I hated Jimmy Harrison, the manager, and the job was a chump job anyway� sweeping floors and changing beds and that kind of thing. The only thing that made it not so bad was me telling myself it was just until I finished school. I saw a lot of guys who had either finished school or had dropped out just hanging around the block, and I didn&#x2019;t want to do that either. I wondered if my days were piling up on me, like my father said they might. They were changing, at least, or maybe I was changing. Or was supposed to be and wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br> I sat in the window for a long time, and then I laid across the bed, just waiting for time to pass. I dozed off for a while, and when I woke, it was just about dark. I thought about going to a movie but decided to save my money so I could go the next day in case it rained. I got a basketball I kept at the Grant and wandered over to the playground. The lights were on, and I figured I&#x2019;d shoot a few baskets. Playing ball, even shooting baskets by myself, always made me feel better. I figured to shoot until I got tired and then come back and get some sleep.<br><br> I had my head so wrapped up in myself I didn&#x2019;t see this guy laying on the court until I got right up on him.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, man.&#x201d; I nudged him with the toe of my sneaker. &#x201c;Get off the court!&#x201d;<br><br> When he didn&#x2019;t move, I thought he might be dead.<br><br> I nudged him again.<br><br> &#x201c;Your feet too big...&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what he said, only he kind of sung it instead of talking.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, man, get up!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I really hate you &#x2019;cause your feet too big...&#x201d;<br><br> The cat is laying there singing some kind of weird song. I pushed him with my sneaker again, and he didn&#x2019;t move. So I gave him a kick on the back of his leg and told him to move again. He rolled over and got up on his knees and hands like a boxer trying to beat the count. I thought he was getting right up, but he just stayed like that for a while. I reached down and grabbed him by the collar and started to drag him off the court, and then, all of a sudden, he&#x2019;s up. Not only is he up, but he&#x2019;s got this blade in my face!<br><br> I dropped the ball and backed off. This guy smells like somebody done peed in bad wine and washed his teeth in it, but he&#x2019;s got this knife, and he&#x2019;s bigger than me.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, why don&#x2019;t you get off the court, man?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I really hates you &#x2019;cause your feets too big...&#x201d; He starts in with this singing again, and I just watched him. I didn&#x2019;t want to get too close to him &#x2019;cause I still didn&#x2019;t know where he got the knife from and he was quick.<br><br> He stops just before he gets off the court and turns back to me and just looks at me, and then he puts his knife away. Right away I feel like busting his jaw. I take a step toward him, and he just grins at me.<br><br> &#x201c;Get off the court, old man, before I hit you!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you put me off the court, youngblood?&#x201d; he says, still grinning.<br><br> I look at him for a minute, and he don&#x2019;t look like much. But I&#x2019;m six three and he&#x2019;s maybe six four, and he&#x2019;s heavier. I wasn&#x2019;t scared of the cat, but I figured it wasn&#x2019;t worth my while. I could hit him and he&#x2019;d have a heart attack and die and I&#x2019;d be up for man� slaughter or something.<br><br> I picked up the ball and shot it. He turned and walked off, still singing that stupid song about feet. I shot a few times, and then the ball came down on something-a broken bottle of wine. I started to push it off the court with my foot, but then I picked it up and threw it off as far as I could. I got the ball again and shot and shot until I was too tired to shoot anymore. Then I took the ball over to the track and ran laps until I could see the sky start turning gray between the buildings.</p><h2>Grace Notes</h2><p>A collection of inspirational messages offering comfort and wisdom for each day of the year approaches such themes as love and grief with a life-affirming joy and presents space for a reader&#39;s personal reflections and insights. 75,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.</p><p><p>Author of twenty-four books, Alexandra Stoddard is a sought-after speaker on the art of living.

Anthony, "has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world."<br><br>NCSS&#x2014;Notable Social Studies Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies 2012<br><br>School Library Journal Best Books of 2011<br><br>Finalist YALSA Excellence in Non Fiction for Young&nbsp;Adults<br><br>SLJ&#x2019;s 100 Magnificent Children&#x2019;s Books of 2011<br><br>Amelia Bloomer List</p><p>SUE MACY is the author of Bulls-Eye: A Photobiography of Annie Oakley; Swifter, Higher, Stronger: A Photographic History of the Summer Olympics; Freeze Frame: A Photographic History of the Winter Olympics; Play Like A Girl: A Celebration of Women in Sports; Winning Ways: A Photohistory of American Women in Sports; and A Whole New Ball Game: The Story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. &nbsp;She brings a consciousness of the history of women in sport to the story of sharpshooter Annie Oakley and carries this mythic and historic figure gracefully into modern light. &nbsp;She has won numerous awards and starred reviews for her books. &nbsp;Winning Ways and A Whole New Ball Game were both named ALA Best Books for Young Adults and NCSS-CBC Notable Children's Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies.<i>&#x201c;Many a girl has come to her ruin through a spin on a country road.&#x201d; &#x2013; Charlotte Smith, Brooklyn Eagle, August 20, 1896</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It was June 29, 1896, and Charlotte Smith was beside herself with concern for the young women of the United States. Smith, the 55-year-old daughter of Irish immigrants, had spent the last decade and a half fighting for the rights of female workers. But now all of her worries about their health and well-being were focused on one wildly popular mechanical object: the bicycle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bicycling by young women has helped to swell the ranks of reckless girls who finally drift into the standing army of outcast women of the United States,&#x201d; wrote Smith in a resolution issued by her group, the Women&#x2019;s Rescue League. &#x201c;The bicycle is the devil&#x2019;s advance agent morally and physically in thousands of instances.&#x201d; Smith&#x2019;s resolution called for &#x201c;all true women and clergymen&#x201d; to join with her in denouncing the bicycle craze among women as &#x201c;indecent and vulgar.&#x201d; She set her sights on New York City as the laboratory for her reform efforts, opening a branch of her Washington-based organization there with the goal of ultimately limiting the use of the bicycle by women. <br> &nbsp;<br> Smith blamed the bicycle for the downfall of women&#x2019;s health, morals, and religious devotion. Her accusations brought a swift and impassioned response. The Reverend Dr. A. Stewart Walsh, a respected clergyman in New York City and a cyclist himself, wrote a letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle declaring. &#x201c;I have associated with thousands of riders...and I have not seen among them . . . anything that could begin to approach the outrageous and scandalous indecency of the resolutions of the alleged rescue league.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ellen B. Parkhurst, wife of another New York minister, celebrated the advantages of bicycle riding in Washington&#x2019;s Evening Times. &#x201c;Of course I do not believe that bicycling is immoral,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A girl who rides a wheel is lifted out of herself and her surroundings. She is made to breathe purer air, see fresher and more beautiful scenes, and get an amount of exercise she would not otherwise get. All this is highly beneficial.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, the impact of the bicycle on the health and welfare of its riders was the subject of a great deal of discussion in the 1890s. At first, the popularity of the safety drew mostly praise as its use seemed to usher in a new era of robust living. Medical literature linked cycling to cures for everything from asthma and diabetes to heart disease and varicose veins, while one study credited the decreasing death rate from consumption (tuberculosis) among women in Massachusetts to their increasing use of the bicycle. Cigar sales took a hit &#x2014; one industry estimate suggested people were buying as many as one million fewer cigars per day &#x2014; because cyclists were too busy exercising to indulge in the smoking habit. And in Chicago, bicycling evidently caused a drop in the use of the painkiller morphine. &#x201c;The morphine takers have discovered that a long spin in the fresh air on a cycle induces sweet sleep better than their favorite drug,&#x201d; reported the British Medical Journal in November 1895.<br></p><h2>The Adventurous Gardener</h2><p>In this gardening classic the forever adventurous Christopher Lloyd takes us on a tour through the garden, stopping to lecture here, to exhort there, to overturn the old and accepted when his experience prompts him.

A veteran film-goer of seventy years who has kept a vigilant eye on changing Hollywood styles and the public tastes that follow, Mr. Crisp discusses both films and stars with his typical panache and dexterity and leads his readers with polite madness to a clear, straightforward moral, proving himself to be an unexpected champion of good sense. Along the way Mr. Crisp shares his personal encounters with the likes of Lillian Gish, John Hurt, David Hockney, Divine, Sting, and Geraldine Page. Prefaced by longer essays on the essence of stardom, the nature of Hollywood, and the deplorable state of that town today, Mr. Crisp's book is a delight to read. </p></p><p><p><b>Quentin Crisp</b> is the author of<i> How to Go to the Movies</i>, among other books.</p>In this collection of film reviews from Christopher Street magazine, Crisp ( The Naked Civil Servant ) declares that "the way to go to movies is incessantly . . . reverently . . . critically," yet he follows only two of his dicta. His almost compulsive movie-going is the basis for highly entertaining reviews that reveal a shameless appreciation for stars--the bigger the name, the better--as well as a fairly simplistic critical approach. But what sets Crisp's work apart from most film reviews is humor ( My Dinner with Andre is "as boring as being alive"); his eye for style (actor Richard Gere looks like Errol Flynn "with the edges beveled"); and a store of off-the-wall remarks ("Mr. Proust was a weirdo"). Unfortunately, the repetition of certain pet peeves (especially the evils of television) underscores a lack of judicious editing, and Crisp's star-worship reveals a fairly reactionary view of the sexes, as in his lamentation that women's liberation "was the final nail hammered into the coffin of stardom." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Scream Away</h2><p>"Kate Brady has made her mark with a taut, masterful debut of chilling suspense that grabs you by the throat and heart and won't let go.

Using the dead woman's phone, he calls Beth Denison, who is haunted by seven years of secrets and terror, and threatens Beth's daughter, Abby. As Bankes continues roaming the Seattle area and torturing women to death, Neil Sheridan, a burned-out ex-FBI agent, joins the investigation through a connection to one of Bankes's earlier murders. Beth and Neil share emotional damage and attraction, revealing their secrets at a lugubrious pace. Their mutual unmasking parallels the desperate dig for clues, but as they race to find Bankes, he invades Beth's home to lie in wait.

She said it loudly. Rosa was not impressed with the basement apartment, or the library above it, or the town of Ingot. She missed their old place in the city. She missed having windows. She missed looking through those windows to see a place that was not Ingot.<br> <br>Her new bedroom was bigger than her old one, but without any outside view the room still seemed smaller. Someone had tried to fix this by installing a fake window frame and painting beautiful landscapes of forests and lakes on the plaster behind it.<br> <br>Rosa closed real curtains over the fake view.<br> <br>This was not home. She could unpack her stuff and spread it around, but that would not make it home. This was just an underground room she happened to be haunting.<br> <br>Rosa went back into the living room. She didn&#x2019;t find much life in there, either. Mom lay flopped across the couch, which was in an awkward place. It blocked the way to the kitchen. Rosa wanted to shove it into its proper place, but it properly belonged in the city, in their old apartment, directly adjacent to the huge central library. Rosa couldn&#x2019;t shove it that far. She couldn&#x2019;t even shove it away from the kitchen because her mother had fallen asleep on it.<br> <br>Mom looked defeated. She also looked content with her defeat, and that was worse.<br> <br>Rosa climbed over her mother, who stayed asleep&#x2014;or at least pretended to sleep&#x2014;and left the apartment. She didn&#x2019;t bring her tool belt. She didn&#x2019;t even know where it was. That didn&#x2019;t matter, though. Not here.<br> <br>She went upstairs to explore the Ingot Public Library.<br> <br>Nice old building. Rosa closed her eyes and smelled the familiar, musty, dusty smell of old books given time to think. Then she opened her eyes and let herself wander into odd corners and unusual nooks. That quickly brought her somewhere she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Special Collections, dear,&#x201d; said a woman with wispy hair, white gloves, and aggressive eyebrows. &#x201c;This is where we keep very old books, maps, and historical records. You need permission to be here. You need to sign the form on the clipboard. And children aren&#x2019;t allowed at all, even if they do sign the form on the clipboard. Children&#x2019;s books are through that door, down the hall, and in the far corner. Please don&#x2019;t touch anything on your way there.&#x201d; Her voice tasted like honey dribbled over raw rhubarb.<br> <br>&#x201c;I live here,&#x201d; Rosa said. She did not want this to be true, but it was, and she felt indignant to have to explain it. &#x201c;We just moved in. My mother is the new appeasement specialist.&#x201d; Librarian appeasement specialists always lived inside their libraries, or at least next to their libraries. They had to be on call at all hours.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; the other librarian said. She took the time to make eye contact now. &#x201c;I see. Though I&#x2019;m not at all sure why such an esteemed specialist has chosen to work here, in Ingot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She just needed a change,&#x201d; Rosa said.<br> <br>Silence stretched thin between them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; the librarian finally said. &#x201c;Well then. Hello. Welcome. I&#x2019;m Mrs. Jillynip. Pleased to meet you. But please don&#x2019;t come and go through this part of the collection. Not without gloves.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Jillynip went away without bothering to learn Rosa&#x2019;s name. Then she watched Rosa sideways to make sure she didn&#x2019;t touch any of the maps. That made Rosa want to touch maps. She wanted to jump up and down on a big pile of maps. But she didn&#x2019;t. Instead she tried to leave by way of a spiral staircase in the corner of the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not there!&#x201d; Mrs. Jillynip snapped. Then she took a breath and tried to be more civil. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t ever go up there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Rosa asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because nothing&#x2019;s up there. And it isn&#x2019;t safe. The whole staircase might come down. Then the Historical Society would be angry with you. Plus you&#x2019;ll probably break both of your legs. Children&#x2019;s books are that way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rosa turned around and went that way. She passed through the children&#x2019;s section. It had more dusty, creepy, glass-eyed stuffed animals than actual books, so she left to explore the rest of her new library. She noticed all the places where haints, ghosts, revenants, specters, the spirits of the living, and the spirits of the dead would collect themselves if this building stood anywhere other than Ingot. She spotted all the little things that would probably offend them, or enrage them, or send them howling in between the bookshelves in the very small hours of the night if this were any other library in any other town.<br> <br>Ingot was not haunted. Ingot was the only unhaunted place that Rosa had ever heard of. The Ingot Public Library did not need an appeasement specialist. It had nothing to appease&#x2014;nothing but Rosa.<br> <br>She moved unappeased through the library stacks until she found the public bathroom. The sink fixtures inside were all copper, polished in some places and stained green in others. Each mirror had a small shelf underneath it, just like mirrors are always supposed to have, but the shelves stood empty. No coins. No pebbles. No candle stubs. A candle would have been especially helpful. Ghosts could use them to rest, or to pass between boundaries. Lit candles could also make nasty smells disappear, and would have been helpful in this particular bathroom.<br> <br>Rosa washed her hands. Then she took a pebble from her pocket and set it on the mirror shelf. This was a decent way to say thanks to a mirror&#x2014;and to anything likely to lurk inside a mirror. It was also a way to greet lost relatives.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi Dad,&#x201d; she said, even though he wasn&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>A blonde girl pushed the bathroom door open. She gave Rosa a funny look. Rosa ignored her intensely and left the bathroom. She needed to leave the building. She hurried through the front lobby and half-ran beneath a portrait of a man with a long, elaborate mustache&#x2014;Bartholomew Theosophras Barron, founder of Ingot Town. Mr. Barron&#x2019;s painted eyes looked into the distance in a self-important way. They didn&#x2019;t follow Rosa as she rushed outside.<br> <br>She went without her tool belt, without matches, chalk, or salt, without any proof of her family profession but another pebble in her pocket and a little copper medallion of Catalina de Erauso, Rosa&#x2019;s patron librarian, around her neck. The medallion showed de Erauso holding a sword above the Latin inscription MEMENTO MORTUIS. &#x201c;Remember the dead.&#x201d; There was nothing special about the pebble.<br> <br>It felt wrong to leave the building without her tool belt. Rosa left anyway. She sat on the library steps and decided she was angry. She liked that decision, even though she knew it wasn&#x2019;t right. Sadness slowed her down. It made the air feel thick to move through and heavy to carry in her lungs. But anger was fuel she could use to move faster. She would rather be mad&#x2014;at Mom for the move, and for taking a job that didn&#x2019;t really need her, and for needing such a clean and brutal break away from their proper work. She would rather be mad at Ingot for its odd, unnatural emptiness of everyone except for the living. So she decided that she was.<br> <br>The town stretched out in front of her. She could see most of it from here. Old houses clustered close together, some in good repair and others run-down and peeling. Mountains surrounded Ingot on all sides like the rim of a bowl or a bucket.<br> <br>Bright green light flashed briefly in the foothills. Rosa stared at the spot where that green flash wasn&#x2019;t anymore. Then a knight in full armor came striding down the sidewalk, and she stared at him instead.</p><h2>The Devil to Pay</h2><p>Stocks rose, stocks fell, but Solly Spaeth always came out ahead.

Their fair-play mysteries won over fans due to their intricate puzzles that challenged the reader to solve the mystery alongside the brilliant detective. Queen&#x2019;s stories were among the first to dominate the earliest days of radio, film, and television.

Monsters are everywhere in this world. But I'm not talking your sweaty pedophile or your serial killer with a cold and silent harem buried in his crawl space. No, I'm talking about the real deal. Creatures that scuttled across the surface of this world when the air was sulfuric acid and the nighttime moon all but blocked out the sky. Scales and fangs, blood that doubled as venom, minds and bodies twisted in concert, dark legends come to life. These legends had always been a reality, but they were one that refused to register on modern human eyes. Monsters, they existed all right, and they were legion, so what was one more?<br><br>Although truthfully, I was only half-monster. My mother was human; my father something...else. When we were younger my brother and I had called them Grendels; the rest of the supernatural world called them Auphe. You say tomato; I say murderous death incarnate. It's all good fun. Auphe were the seed of the elf fantasy, believe it or not, but this seed was poisonous, and it would kill anything it touched. There was no blond hair or limpid blue eyes, no silken voices like a temple bell. There was only skin as palely transparent as that of a salamander, eyes the red of lava, and a mind blackened and putrid as a rotting swamp. Okay, they did have the pointed ears; I'll give you that. Sometimes legends do get the facts right, but that's not much comfort when a thousand metal teeth are buried in your throat.<br><br>Half-monster or whole, in the end it didn't matter. I had my weaknesses, same as anyone else. And I was facing one of them now.<br><br>Clowns.<br><br>Yeah, that's what I said. Clowns. I hate clowns. Always have. Point one out to me at the age of three and I would run wailing in the other direction as if the Hounds of Hell had been set on my diapered ass. Even now they still gave me a chill, and wasn't that pretty damn ludicrous? I'd fought creatures more monstrous than the mind could grasp. And I was related to things even worse than that, but bottom line, none of it mattered. I just hated clowns. And honestly, what self-respecting person doesn't? Name one, just one person whose flesh didn't crawl at the sight of them. Those puffy, bloated hands. The tiny gleaming eyes buried in pits of black paint. That maniacal grin awash in lurid scarlet, red as blood. Whose blood? you'd wonder uneasily to yourself. Could be yours if you didn't waddle away fast enough on chunky toddler legs. Then there were the people who dressed like cartoon animals, lolling plush tongues, glassy saucer eyes, and thick, unhinged laughs. They were nasty in their own right, but they still had nothing on clowns. Jesus Christ. Don't kids have enough to warp them in this world?<br><br>"They're only bodachs, Cal," Niko's voice came with a cool amusement that had me throwing him a black scowl. "You could handle a bodach long before you were potty trained. Granted, that was less than a month ago..."<br><br>My brother, his bedside manner was less hand-holding and more a nice brisk thwap to the back of the head. "They're not just bodachs," I gritted. "They're bodachs in clown makeup. And that, Cyrano, makes all the difference in the goddamn world."<br><br>The Roman nose made even more generous by Niko's newly shorn hair snorted. "Still with the clowns?" Several months ago Niko's dark blond hair, most often in a ponytail or braid, had trailed nearly to the base of his spine. Now it barely touched his ears&#x2014;or would have if he hadn't ruthlessly skimmed it back. He had cut his hair in mourning, a custom of our Greek ancestors. It was one of the few tales our mother had bothered to share with us. The Gypsy clan she'd grown up in had roamed all of Europe hundreds of years ago. They weren't called Travelers for nothing. Before eventually making their way to the good old USA, they'd settled for a time in Greece, intermarrying with the natives on occasion although it was frowned upon by both sides. The result was an odd mixture of Rom and Greek traditions that had lost Niko his hair. I gave him hell about it, but not as much as I could have. After all, he'd done it to grieve my death, to mourn me. Smart-ass comments tended to shrivel in my mouth in the face of that.<br><br>And I had died, although it had been a temporary thing. First Niko had stabbed me, and then a healer friend had stopped my heart. My death had lasted only seconds, but dead I had been. Not that I held a grudge. It was all done in an effort to stop the creature that had taken control of me&#x2014;a creature bent on remaking the world. On remaking me. Even a permanent death would've been better than what it had planned.<br><br>Yeah, for sheer awe-inspiring terror, that thing had given clowns a run for their money.<br><br>"Yes," I snarled. "Still with the clowns."<br><br>The carnival was closed for the night, all spiderweb metal and lonely winds rocking the buckets of the rides, especially those of the Ferris wheel. The wheel itself loomed like a petrified skeleton, the slouching beast that had never made Bethlehem. Here its carcass rotted, its bones a darkly encrusted silver hung with the white twinkle of diamonds. The lingering smell of grease and butter had turned rancid, and a cheap and torn stuffed dog, the prize in any number of fixed games, lay at the base of a garbage can. One blank button eye had been torn away leaving a raveled stuffing socket. Poor bastard, he'd missed his ride to the Island of Misfit Toys. The yellow bulbs strung here and there were either dead or dim as a candle flame. Beneath it all there was the scuttle of rats' claws and the scuttle of something far more lethal. All in all, I could've chosen a better location for our first job. In fact, a mentally challenged plaster garden gnome could've done better.<br><br>"I liked working at the bar better." What was that in the shadows? The pale glimmer of greasepaint? "The only clowns in bars are smart-ass drunks who don't tip."<br><br>To my right, Niko continued to observe me with brotherly disdain. Dressed in black pants and shirt, he would've blended into the night if not for the lighter gleam of his short hair. He'd recently grown a closely shorn immaculately maintained goatee&#x2014;probably to keep the zen hair ratio happy&#x2014;which was equally bright against his olive skin. My own hair was indistinguishable from the shadows around us. Normally I pulled it back into a short tail, but tonight I let it fall free to obscure some of the full-moon shade of my skin. Niko could afford to give himself away; he was Bruce Lee with a bleach job. I, on the other hand, didn't mind a little extra help. Don't get me wrong; I could hold my own against most things that go bump in the night. Vampires, werewolves, boggles, ghouls...trolls were a little more problematic. Whatever was out there, I could face it, but this time....<br><br>Strong fingers came over and squeezed an imaginary round red nose that must've hung just before mine. "Honk. Honk," Niko said with the utmost gravity. Picture it if you will. One of the most lethal fighters in the tristate area, a man who in the game of kill-or-be-killed was solidly king of the former category, and he was honking. Honking. Jesus.<br><br>"You know, since you started getting some, you are really beginning to piss me off." I started into the depths of the carnival, not bothering to check to see if he was following. He was. It wasn't something I had to see or hear to know. Niko watched my back, always. The mountains would fall and the oceans dry to dust before that ever changed.<br><br>"One day, little man." A fleeting pat came on my shoulder. "One day."<br><br>I didn't respond, only twisted my shoulders slightly and kept moving. That wasn't a subject for discussion, not now and definitely not here. Niko was smart, so damn smart, but when it came to his baby brother he wasn't as calculating or logical as he could've been. Should've been. To me there were things that were clear, so clear, it made me wonder why no one else seemed able to see what I could so effortlessly.<br><br>"Cal?" Niko might not see what I saw, but he could see when something wasn't quite right. When you know someone your whole life you can read them quicker than the morning comics, even when they might not want you to.<br><br>I ignored the question in the shape of my name and walked on with my eyes searching every inky clot of darkness. "Cal." This time it wasn't a question; it was a demand. And knowing Nik, an undeniable one.<br><br>I can honestly say it was the only time in my life I was glad to see a clown. Even one who was doing his level best to disembowel me with seven-inch-long razor-edged nails. It shot out of a mound of trash, the furious motion surrounding it in a shower of stale popcorn, stained napkins...and fluttering hanks of children's hair. The silky strands hung like party streamers from jetty claws&#x2014;the same claws that were flying at me. The old Scottish legend, as methodically stuffed in my head by Niko, said a bodach would slither down a house's chimney much like a satanic Santa Claus to eat whatever children it could find, flesh, skin, bones, and all. Every scrap...except the hair. It didn't like the hair.<br><br>I felt my stomach twist into a sharp-edged tangle until I recognized the silver locks for what they where. The bodach held a dirty-faced doll in one multijointed hand, a doll with matching blond hair. The fall of hair from its other hand was nothing more than a rain of cheap polyester. It didn't change the fact that it all too easily could have been real. Bodachs aren&#x2019;t known for their willpower in the dieting field. It made the clown costume so chilling perfect...the ideal camouflage to snare the innocent.<br><br>Atop the grimy clown suit of blue, green, and curdled cream, under the ridiculous corkscrew wig and white paint, was the face behind the tale. The mummy brown skin was camouflaged by the thick pigment, but the thickly smiling lips did nothing to conceal teeth equally as brown from dried blood. When it grinned you would almost swear its head turned inside out, and it was grinning now like Jack the Ripper on Ladies' Night as it dropped the doll and came for me. I lunged to one side, grabbed the thing's arm with my free hand, and pulled, letting it continue its motion on past me. As the claws and bone white hand cleared my ribs with room to spare, I buried the muzzle of the Glock under a vulpine chin and blew off the top of its curly orange head.<br><br>The body fell with limbs twitching in the dance of the electrified. And the smell...on their bast day bodachs weren't exactly as fresh as daisies. A dying one put off a reek that would take paint off a car. It certainly took the edge off my appetite. Covering my mouth and nose, I felt the distinctive taste of bile creep into my mouth. "Holy shit. That is rank." It was a number of things worse than that, but I couldn't get into them without spewing my supper. One of the quirky little side effects of being not exactly human was an excellent sense of smell. I was no wolf, but I'd give a drug-sniffing dog a run for its money. Right now, however, the only running I wanted to do was out of range of this god-awful, hideous stench. Clamping my lips tight, I swallowed several times and blinked watering eyes. It was that pained moisture that had me doubting the sight before me.<br><br>The bodach had stopped quivering. Normally that was good, great even. All hail the conquering heroes. Strike up the band, toss us the key to the city, and slap some green across our palms. Unfortunately, normally wasn't the case here. It stopped quivering because it got up. That's right. With the top of its head split open like a rotten egg, it rose to its feet and grinned jack-o'-lantern wide around the blood pouring from its mouth. That was more than disturbing enough, but when it started talking...it was a whole new repulsive ball game.<br><br>"Little...boy...blue," it gurgled, each word fighting to the surface. "Blow your horn." It spit derisively, turning the ground black at its feet, and then pointed a claw at the gun dangling from my hand. "Blow your horn." Then it moved for me, not as fluidly as when it had first attacked, but neither was it coming at a slow stagger.<br><br>"You have got to be shitting me," I said in disbelief. As I spoke, the slashing claws came closer. But worse than that, so much worse, was that so did the smell. That, more than the other considerations, had me moving fast. This time I shot it in the kneecaps, assuming it had kneecaps. Whatever peculiar monster parts that allowed its legs to bend, that's what I put a few bullets through. It fell again, yet still it kept coming, dragging itself by jutting knife nails and clown-suit-covered elbows. So I shot those too.<br><br>"Blow your horn," it hissed, spraying blood. "Blow your horn." And on it wriggled with the jerky movements of a broken-backed snake.<br><br>Looking down at my gun and then back at the bodach, I was giving serious consideration to throwing the useless piece of shit at it when an infinitely patient sigh blew the hair by my ear. Tapping my shoulder lightly with the hilt of his sword, Niko asked calmly, "Are you done playing yet?"<br><br>The smug son of a bitch. I waved my gun hand and took a few steps back, hoping for more breathable air. "Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out."<br><br>Moving past me with silent grace, he hefted the falchion and then swung it with a speed that was a blur of shimmering silver. Broad and curved, the blade bit through the bodach's neck, decapitating it instantly. The head rolled, bounced off the side of my foot, and promptly tried to bite my ankle. I punted it hard and hissed as the smell clung to my sneaker. "We should've brought a tree shredder," I grunted, rubbing the back of my hand across my nose futilely. All right. Fine. If that was the way this night was going to be, I'd just have to roll with it. Grimly, I toed off my shoes and booted them and the stench far away from me. "Can I borrow a backup since this is next to friggin' useless?" I asked, shoving the gun into my shoulder holster.<br><br>I wasn't making an unreasonable assumption to think that Niko would have an extra something sharp on him. What would be far-fetched would be to imagine that his surplus consisted of only one. Niko could set off metal detectors from a hundred feet with all the weapons he carried. His hand disappeared in his long duster, less of a fashion statement and more of a repository of all that was lethal in the world, and reappeared with a small cardboard box. It wasn't quite what I expected and I accepted the box dubiously. "What the hell?"<br><br>"Explosive rounds." He continued as I gave a low whistle, "You'd be amazed at what they peddle in some dark alleys."<br><br>More happy than amazed actually, but it didn't stop me from immediately loading the gun. While Niko was a worshipper of the blade, I was of a more modern bent. If I could kill from a hundred feet away, hey, it meant fewer dry cleaning bills. What's not to appreciate in that? "Nice. Nothing like an early Christmas present."<br><br>"Are you set for any close-up work?" The tone was that of an old-fashioned nun asking if I'd done my homework. Only this nun walked softly and carried a razor-edged ruler. I snorted and pulled my own blade. This one was more a knife than a sword, but it was the type you saw in mail-order magazines...the kind that had mer...</p><h2>Troubling a Star</h2><p>Children&#39;s Fiction by award winning author Madeleine L&#39;Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time.

The result is a scintillating look at how the forces of love and desire will enrich and complicate life.<br><br>Sting's lyrics from his amazing song echo the feelings of an entire generation. Here is a true love song from the 1990s, full of ambiguities, self-doubt, hope, and mysticism. In Sting's vision, we discover that the truth of the heart is often masked by forces beyond our control. These are words that reverberate with feeling, much like the images painted by the ever controversial Picasso.<br><br>Both these artists share the ability to make the world see itself in a new light. Picasso painted his subjects--particularly the women he loved--unlike any artist before or after him, and the world was changed because of his vision. In a similar way, the complexity of Sting's words elevate and expand popular music into previously uncharted territory. <br><br>Together, these words and images--like all messages from the heart--will make the perfect gift of love.</p><p>"I know that the spades are swords of a soldier / I know that the clubs are weapons of war / I know that diamonds mean money for this art / But that's not the shape of my heart." So goes the chorus of <i>Shape of My Heart</i>, lyrics composed and sung by Grammy Award-winning songwriter Sting. In this lovely, oversized book, Sting's words are spread across the pages and complemented with paintings by the visionary artist Pablo Picasso. This treatment allows for a leisurely and thoughtful contemplation of both the poetry and the artwork, as the words and images play with and against each other, sparking readers' imaginations. The combination is an evocative and powerful one, perhaps because both artists are known for opening minds and hearts--shedding fresh, revealing light on what we thought we already understood completely. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>Sting (b. 1951) has recorded eight albums with The Police and ten solo albums, won over a dozen Grammy awards, and appeared in 14 films and numerous stage productions. He is also an activist with Amnesty International and the Rainforest Foundation.<br><br>Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) was one of the seminal artists of the 20th century.

She misses Christmas past, when her family gathered together around a little tree, with feelings of love and goodwill. But this year it seems as if everybody in Bear Country has gone Christmas-crazy -- fighting for the last toy on the shelf, jamming the roadways with honking cars, and covering Bear homes with enough Christmas lights to blot out the stars. </p><p>Mama Bear isn't the only one who thinks this Christmas lacks the true holiday spirit. Someone is watching the Bears on his scanner-machine -- someone who knows more about Christmas than anyone and doesn't like what he sees one bit. It is Santa Bear, of course, and he's ready to take drastic action! Only the Berenstain Bears can change his mind, but will they be in time to save Christmas?</p><p>Like the Bear family, Stan, Jan, and Mike Berenstain have the true Christmas spirit in their hearts, and they prove it with this merry holiday story.</p></p><p><p>Stan and Jan Berenstain were already successful cartoonists for magazines and adult humor books when they began writing children's books. The first story starring the bear family, <em>The Big Honey Hunt</em>, appeared in 1962. Since then, more than 250 Berenstain Bears books have been published, and more than 260 million copies have been sold. What began as an idea sparked by their young sons' interest in children's books has become over the years arguably the best-selling children's book series ever. </p><p>Since their inception, the Berenstain Bears stories have expanded to include picture books, beginning readers, and chapter books&#x2014;even a hit TV show on PBS. Writing and illustrating the books has become a Berenstain family affair. Mike joined with his parents as a creative team in the late 1980s. The Bear family has expanded over the years as well. Sister Bear arrived in 1974, and baby Honey joined the family in 2000. </p><p>Since Stan's death at age eighty-two in 2005, Jan and Mike have continued to write and illustrate wonderful new adventures for Mama, Papa, Brother, Sister, and Honey Bear. They live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which looks a lot like Bear Country. </p><br><br><p>Mike Berenstain lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he continues to write and illustrate wonderful new adventures for Mama, Papa, Brother, Sister, and Honey Bear.</p>Grade 1-3-From e-mails he receives from cubs, and by observing on his scanner machine, Santa Bear concludes that Christmas has been ruined: families are rude and competitive and the "-Christmas greedies were spreading through the land." He sets out, incognito, to search for the true spirit of the season. Luckily, Mama Bear has already put the brakes on, and the Bear family has reformed when disguised Santa arrives. Once again, a moral imperative is pounded home in the Berenstains' familiar, formulaic way. Problems of the overlong text, the meter that doesn't scan, and the canned illustrations will hardly matter to the Bears' many fans.-S.

To the contrary, Elizabeth Caldwell Hirschman's research indicates the earliest settlers were of Mediterranean extraction, and of a Jewish or Muslim religious persuasion. Sometimes called &#x201c;Melungeons,&#x201d; these early settlers were among the earliest nonnative &#x201c;Americans&#x201d; to live in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. For fear of discrimination&#x2013;since Muslims, Jews, &#x201c;Indians,&#x201d; and other &#x201c;persons of color&#x201d; were often disenfranchised and abused&#x2013;the Melungeons were reticent regarding their heritage. In fact, over time, many of the Melungeons themselves &#x201c;forgot&#x201d; where they came from. Hence, today, the Melungeons remain the &#x201c;last lost tribe in America,&#x201d; even to themselves. Yet, Hirschman, supported by DNA testing, genealogies, and a variety of historical documents, suggests that the Melungeons included such notable early Americans as Daniel Boone, John Sevier, Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Andrew Jackson.

Taking up photography in 1915 for the purpose of reproducing his paintings, he earned money doing the same for others when he went to live and work in Paris in 1921. This led to one of the richest careers in the history of photography, ranging from portraits of celebrated artists, musicians, and writers such as Andre Breton, Marcel Duchamp, Erik Satie, Arnold Sch�nberg, T. S. Eliot, and Gertrude Stein, to the pictures using light effects outside the camera for which he is famous (cliche-verres, rayographs, and solarizations). These photographs are among the most exciting and revealing manifestations of the profusely fertile artistic impulse which made Man Ray equally celebrated as a painter, sculptor, writer, and filmmaker. Besides many classic images, this book includes a huge number of photographs that have never been seen before, including portraits of Virginia Woolf and Antonin Artaud and a large selection of erotic pictures. They add up to a truly revealing look at Man Ray, whom Cocteau called &#34;the great poet of the darkroom.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)A marvelous, perhaps definitive, book on the artist. -- <i><i>Boston Globe</i></i><br><br>Wonderfully disconcerting. -- <i><i>Modern Photography</i></i></p><h2>The Red and the Green</h2><p>An Irish family becomes involved in events leading up to the Easter Rebellion</p><p>Introduction by Declan Kiberd <br> <br>The scene is Dublin in 1916.

Using this as a starting point, The MOJO Collection charts the evolution of the L.P. over seven decades, through reviews of much-loved classics and little-known masterpieces, right up to Coldplay&#39;s acclaimed A Rush of Blood to the Head, Eminem&#39;s The Marshall Mathers LP, and Norah Jones&#39;s Come Away With Me. Revised, redesigned, and expanded for the first time, this collection now contains over seven hundred specially commissioned reviews by forty of the world&#39;s top music journalists. These reviews offer fascinating, surprising, and authoritative new perspectives into the genesis and importance of each album. Every entry comes with recording and production details and much more. The page layout and indexing systems have been thoroughly redesigned for user-friendliness, so readers can follow clear signposts to similar albums, contemporary works, and artists&#39; influences. As a new feature, Top Five albums from various artists, along with billboard statistics from down the years are interspersed throughout. Articles on areas of music that didn&#39;t revolve around the L.P. format, plus a listing of essential sound tracks and the hundred greatest compilation albums of all time, add even more.</p><p>Jim Irvin learnt to read by scrutinising record labels.

His death could easily go unnoticed as Rommel's tanks charge through the desert in an attempt to open the Middle East to Hitler's forces. Yet the mystery behind Stern's death is a top priority for intelligence experts. Master spies from three countries converge on Joe O'Sullivan Beare, who is closer to Stern than anyone, in an effort to unravel the disturbing puzzle. The search for the truth about Stern leads O'Sullivan Beare through the slums of Cairo to a decaying former brothel called the Hotel Babylon. </p></p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio</p><h2>Hip-Hop and Philosophy: Rhyme 2 Reason (Popular Culture &amp; Philosophy)</h2><p>Is there too much violence in hip-hop music? What&#x2019;s the difference between Kimberly Jones and the artist Lil' Kim? Is hip-hop culture a "black" thing? Is it okay for N.W.A. to call themselves niggaz and for Dave Chappelle to call everybody bitches? These witty, provocative essays ponder these and other thorny questions, linking the searing cultural issues implicit and often explicit in hip-hop to the weighty matters examined by the great philosophers of the past. The book shows that rap classics by Lauryn Hill, OutKast, and the Notorious B.I.G. can help uncover the meanings of love articulated in Plato's <i>Symposium; </i>that Rakim, 2Pac, and Nas can shed light on the conception of God's essence expressed in St. Thomas Aquinas's <i>Summa Theologica;</i> and explores the connection between Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg, and Hegel. <i>Hip-Hop and Philosophy</i> proves that rhyme and reason, far from being incompatible, can be mixed and mastered to contemplate life's most profound mysteries.</p><p>"When academics get their groove on, expressing their ideas in a freestyle symposium such as this, everyone should take notice." -- <i>ZINK Magazine, November, 2005</i><br><br>A delightful, fun presentation invites college students to understand underlying meanings in ancient and modern texts. -- <i>California BookWatch 03/06</i></p><h2>The Post Office: A Memoir of His Father</h2><p>&#34;The Post Office: a memoir of his father&#34;. with an introduction by George F.

It&#x2019;s long enough and sharp enough to slit your own throat,&#x2019; our guardian warned me, the night before I left home to go to the royal court at Versailles. He sat at the head of the long wooden table in the chateau&#x2019;s arched dining room, lifting his lip in distaste as the servants brought us our usual peasant fare of sausage and white-bean cassoulet. He had not accustomed himself to our simple Gascon ways, not even after six years.<br>I just laughed. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you know a woman&#x2019;s tongue is her sword? You wouldn&#x2019;t want me to let my only weapon rust, would you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No chance of that.&#x2019; The Marquis de Maul�vrier was a humourless man, with a face like a goat and yellowish eyes that followed my sister and me as we went about our business. He thought our mother had spoilt us, and had set himself to remedy our faults. I loathed him. No, loathe is far too soft a word. I detested him.<br><br>My sister, Marie, said, &#x2018;Please, my lord, you mustn&#x2019;t mind her. You know we&#x2019;re famous here in Gascony for our troubadours and minstrels. We Gascons love to sing songs and tell stories. She means no harm by it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I love to tell a gasconade,&#x2019; I sang. &#x2018;A braggadocio, a fanfaronade . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Marie sent me a look. &#x2018;You know that Charlotte-Rose will need honey on her tongue if she&#x2019;s to make her way in this world.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sangdieu, but it&#x2019;s true. Her face won&#x2019;t make her fortune.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s unfair, my lord. Charlotte-Rose has the sweetest face . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;She might be passable if only she&#x2019;d pluck out that sting in her tail,&#x2019; the Marquis de Maul�vrier began. Seeing that I had screwed up my face like a gargoyle, waggling my tongue at him, he rapped his spoon on the pitted tabletop. &#x2018;You&#x2019;d best sweeten your temperament, mademoiselle, else you&#x2019;ll find yourself with a heart of gall.&#x2019;<br><br>I should have listened to him.</p> <p><br>Palais de Versailles, France &#x2013; January 1697<br><br>Full of regret, I clung to the strap as my carriage rolled away from the Palais de Versailles. It was a bleak and miserable day, the sky bruised with snow clouds. I was sure my nose must be red; it certainly felt red. I drew my fur-edged cloak closer about me, glad that I would not, at least, arrive at my prison looking like a pauper.<br><br>I still could not believe that the King would order me to a nunnery. Apparently, it was in punishment for some impious No�ls that I had written, but all the women of the salons made subtle mock of the church. It seemed a harsh punishment for such a petty crime. Surely the King did not believe the rumours that I was having an affair with his son? The Dauphin and I were friends, drawn together by our love of art and music and novels, and our hatred of the King. Perhaps I had been too bold in expressing my views. Perhaps my tongue &#x2013; and my quill &#x2013; had grown a little sharp. I had thought myself safe under the Dauphin&#x2019;s protection. The Dauphin always said, though, that the one way for him to ensure his father punished someone was to beg his father to offer that man a favour.<br><br>Perched on the other seat, my maid, Nanette, gazed at me unhappily but I would not meet her eyes. <br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s all a great misunderstanding,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;The King will soon summon me back.&#x2019; I tried to smile.<br><br>&#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t you have gone to him and begged his pardon, Bon-bon?&#x2019; Nanette asked.<br><br>&#x2018;I did try,&#x2019; I answered. &#x2018;But you know the King. He must be the most unforgiving man in Christendom.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Bon-bon!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s no use scolding me, Nanette. I&#x2019;m simply telling the truth.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But to be locked up in a convent. To become a nun.&#x2019; Nanette&#x2019;s voice was faint with horror. &#x2018;Your parents must be rolling in their graves.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What were my choices? Exile or the convent. At least, this way, the King will still pay my pension and I&#x2019;ll be on French soil, breathing French air. Where else could I have gone? What could I have done to support myself? I&#x2019;m too old and ugly to walk the streets.&#x2019;<br><br>Nanette&#x2019;s face puckered. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not old or ugly.&#x2019;<br><br>I laughed. &#x2018;Not to you, perhaps, Nanette. But, believe me, most people at Versailles consider me a hideous old hag. I&#x2019;m forty-seven years old, and not even my closest friends ever thought I was a beauty.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re not a hideous old hag,&#x2019; Nanette protested. &#x2018;Not beautiful, no, but there&#x2019;s better things than beauty in this world.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Belle laide, Ath�na�s calls me,&#x2019; I replied with a little shrug. The expression was usually used to describe a woman who was arresting despite the plainness of her looks. My guardian had spoken truly when he said my face would never be my fortune.<br><br>Nanette made a little tsk tsk with her tongue. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re worth twice the Marquise de Montespan. Don&#x2019;t you listen to a word she says. And don&#x2019;t you go thinking you&#x2019;re a hideous old hag either. I wouldn&#x2019;t permit anyone to say that about me, and in my case it&#x2019;s true.&#x2019;<br><br>I smiled despite myself. Nanette was not the most attractive of women. She was tiny and gaunt, dressed always in black, with sparse white hair screwed back into a knob at the back of her head. Her face and body were so thin that you could see all the bones underneath her withered skin, and she had lost quite a few teeth. Her black eyes were fierce, but her hands were always tender and her brain quite as nimble as it had ever been.<br><br>Nanette had been my maid ever since I was weaned from my wet-nurse. As a child, I would lie in my vast shadowy bed, a flame floating in the old glass lantern, and sleepily listen as she sang, &#x2018;You have searched me, Lord, and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.&#x2019; Nanette was like the Lord in that psalm. Before a word was on my tongue, she knew it completely. She hemmed me in behind and before, and her hand held me fast.<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d best write to your sister straightaway and let her know what&#x2019;s happened,&#x2019; Nanette went on. <br><br>&#x2018;Marie&#x2019;s not clever like you, but she&#x2019;s got a good heart. She&#x2019;ll beg that fat husband of hers to petition the King.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll write to the Princesses too,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll be furious with their father. He simply cannot go around banishing all the most interesting people from court, can he?&#x2019;<br><br>Nanette humphed, but the thought of the King&#x2019;s three pipe-smoking, bastard-born daughters lifted my spirits a little. Born of two of the King&#x2019;s mistresses, they had been legitimised and married off to various dukes and princes, and they enlivened the court with their scandalous love affairs, their extravagance, their gambling and their constant bickering over precedence. Although they were much younger than me, we had become good friends, and I often attended their soir�es and salons.<br><br>My smile slowly faded. The Princesses de Conti were no longer in favour with the King and his reigning mistress, Fran�oise de Maintenon, who had been queen in all but name for more than fifteen years now. Some even whispered that Louis had married her in secret. Yet Fran�oise had none of the beauty and brilliance of the King&#x2019;s earlier mistresses. Not only was she over sixty, but she was also rather plain and dumpy, and altogether too pious for the King&#x2019;s bastard daughters.<br><br>Remembering the Princesses, it occurred to me that their mothers, the royal mistresses, had all ended their dazzling careers within the austere confines of a convent.<br><br>Louise de la Valli�re, the King&#x2019;s first mistress and mother of Princess Marie-Anne, had been transformed into S&#x153;ur Louise de la Mis�ricorde.<br><br>Ath�na�s, the Marquise de Montespan, mother of Princess Louise Fran�oise and Princess Fran�oise Marie, had been forced to the nunnery by scandal and rumours of black magic and poison.<br>The frivolous Ang�lique de Fontanges, the girl who had supplanted Ath�na�s in the King&#x2019;s affection, had died in a convent at the age of twenty. Poisoned, it was said.<br><br>I was a fool. Why would the King hesitate to banish me to a nunnery, when he had no problem sending his discarded mistresses, the mothers of his children? Women were locked up in convents all the time. Younger daughters sent as babies, so their parents did not have to pay so rich a dowry as they would for their wedding day. Rebellious young women, cloistered away to punish them for disobedience. Widows, like my poor mother, banished by the King to a convent, even though she was a Huguenot and so feared and hated the Roman Catholic Church with all her heart.<br><br>Even though I was pretending not to care, my stomach was knotted with anxiety. I knew little about convents except that once a woman disappeared inside, she stayed inside. Nanette had often told me the story of how Martin Luther&#x2019;s wife, a former nun, had only been able to escape by hiding in an empty fish barrel. Certainly, I had never seen my own mother again.<br><br>The only life I knew was the court of the Sun King. I had lived at court since I was sixteen years old. What did I know about spending my days on my knees, praying and clicking away at a rosary?<br>I&#x2019;d never make love again, or dance, or gallop to the hounds, or smile as I made a whole salon of Parisian courtiers laugh and applaud one of my stories. I&#x2019;d never rest my folded fan against my heart, saying in the silent language of the court that my heart was breaking with love. I&#x2019;d never be kissed again.<br><br>The tears came at last. Nanette passed me the handkerchief she had kept ready on her knee. I dabbed at my eyes, but the tears kept coming, making my chest heave in its tight cage of lacing, and no doubt making a terrible mess of my maquillage.<br><br>The carriage paused and I heard the sound of the palace gates being opened. Casting down the handkerchief, I swung aside the curtain that hid the view from my sight. Footmen in curly wigs and long satin vests stood to attention as the side wing of the golden gates was swung open by guards. Crowds of shabby peasants shoved forward, eager to see what fine lord or lady was leaving Versailles.<br><br>Holding my lace headdress in place, I leant out the coach window for one last glimpse of the palace at the end of the avenue, the marble forecourt, the prancing bronze horse, the green triangles of topiary in pots marching past like dragoons. The carriage rolled forward, the sounds of the wheels changing as they left the smooth marble flagstones and began to rattle over the cobblestones of the Avenue de Paris. I sank back into my seat. &#x2018;Adieu, Versailles, adieu,&#x2019; I cried.<br><br>&#x2018;Come, my little cabbage, you must stop.&#x2019; Nanette took her handkerchief and mopped my face as if I was a child. &#x2018;I thought you hated court. I thought you said it was filled with empty-headed fools.&#x2019;<br><br>I jerked my face away and stared out at the tall crowded houses of Versailles. It was true that I hated the royal court. Yet I loved it too. The theatre, the music and dancing, the literary salons . . .<br><br>&#x2018;I should&#x2019;ve whipped you more often as a child,&#x2019; Nanette said sadly.<br><br>&#x2018;More often? You never whipped me, though you threatened to often enough.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I know. That&#x2019;s what I mean. Such a tempestuous little thing you were. Either up in the boughs or down in the dumps &#x2013; there was never any middle ground for you. I should&#x2019;ve taught you better.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, Maul�vrier did his best to beat some sense into me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That cold-hearted snake.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I always thought he looked more like a goat.&#x2019; I took the handkerchief back from Nanette and blew my nose.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, a goat, an old devil goat. I bet he had horns under that velvet hat of his.&#x2019;<br><br>Normally, I would have said, &#x2018;Yes, and cloven hooves instead of feet, and a tail sticking out of his arse.&#x2019; Instead, I sighed and leant my aching head against the cushion. All I could see out the window were dreary fields under a dismal sky. Snow floated past, melting as soon as it hit the wet cobblestones. The clop of the horses&#x2019; hooves and the rattle of the wheels were the only sounds.<br><br>&#x2018;Ah, my poor little Bon-bon,&#x2019; Nanette sighed, and I passed her back her handkerchief so she could mop her own eyes.<br><br>Soon, we passed the turn-off to Paris, and I caught my breath with pain. Would I ever see Paris again? I remembered when I had first come to the royal court, still resident then in Paris. My sister had warned me to be careful. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a dangerous place, Bon-bon. Keep a guard on your tongue, else you&#x2019;ll be in trouble, just like the marquis says.&#x2019;<br><br>I had been on my best behaviour at first, charming and amusing at all times. I had thought the court like a gilded cage of butterflies, all beauty and wonder and movement. I had grown careless. I had enjoyed my own sharp wit, my boldness. I had played with words like a jongleur juggled swords, and I had cut myself.<br><br>A fool&#x2019;s tongue is long enough to slit his own throat, the Marquis de Maul�vrier had always said. I hated to admit that he could be right.<br><br>We crossed the River Seine and headed south through a dark and dripping forest. Although Nanette had packed a basket of provisions, I could not eat. The carriage came slowly down a hill, the postilion dismounting to lead the horses, and then we swayed and jolted forward on execrable roads into an early dusk. I shut my eyes, leant my head back against the wall and determined to endure. My name meant strength. I would be strong.<br><br>When the carriage came to a halt, I jerked awake. My heart constricted. I peered out the window but all I could see was the hazy yellow light of a single lantern, illuminating a stone wall. It was freezing.<br><br>&#x2018;Quick, my powder, my patches!&#x2019;<br><br>Nanette passed me my powder box and I flicked the haresfoot over my face, squinting into the tiny mirror at the back of the box. My hands were deft and sure; this was not the first time I had had to repair my maquillage in the dark.<br><br>I snapped my powder box shut and thrust it at her, snatching the small jewelled container in which I kept my patches, the little beauty spots made of gummed taffeta that were very useful at hiding pimples or smallpox scars. My fingers were trembling so much I could hardly pluck out one of the tiny black shapes. For a moment, I hesitated. Normally, I would press my patch to the corner of my mouth, � la coquette, or beside my eye, � la passionn�e, but it was a convent I was about to sweep into, not a salon or ballroom. Carefully, I fixed the patch in the centre of my forehead, just under my hairline, � la majestueuse.<br><br>I was Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de la Force. My grandfather had been the Marshal of France, my cousin was a duke, my mother second cousin to the King himself. If I must enter a nunnery &#x2013; quite against my own wishes &#x2013; it would be in my finest clothes, with my head held high and no traces of tears on my face.<br><br>The postilion opened the carriage door. I descended as gracefully as I could in my high heels, though my feet were numb and my legs trembled after the long hours rattled over potholes. Nanette caught up my train to stop it dragging in the snow.<br><br>The yard was deserted, a lantern hanging above a barred oaken door providing the only light. Above the door were carved rows of stern-faced saints sitting in judgement upon cringing devils and sinners, who pleaded for mercy below. In the wan and flickering light, the sinners&#x2019; stone limbs seemed...</p></p><h2>Information</h2><p>Information</p><p><p>"Mr. Amis is his generation's top literary dog...Dazzling...You're never out of reach of a sparkly phrase, stiletto metaphor or drop-dead insight into the human condition...Mr. Amis goes where other humorists fear to tread...Look out, Flaubert!

The portrait that emerges is of a cultural innovator as celebrated as he was often misunderstood, and a writer increasingly driven as much by what he loved as by what he opposed. <i>A Writer of Our Time</i> brings the many faces of John Berger together, repatriating one of our great minds to the intellectual dramas of his and our time.</p></p><p><p><b>Joshua Sperling</b> was born in New York City and grew up in California.

The fifth of his paternal aunts has joined her siblings on an extended visit, and the collective chaos of their menagerie&#x2014;a monkey, several dogs, and a parrot with an attitude (not to mention the aunts themselves)&#x2014;pervades every corner of his once quiet, orderly home. Just when Edmund thinks things can't get worse, the aunts decide he has been single long enough, and begin a matchmaking campaign in earnest. As if he doesn't have enough problems with women, the intrepid Lady Jane Parker-Roth, a veteran of eight London seasons, decides to join him as he searches for pieces of a sketch that hold the answer to a scandalous mystery. It's a laugh a minute as the determined aunts carry out their plans to make their nephew a happy man&#x2014;whether he wants it or not&#x2014;and Jane blithely ignores his orders. Brimming with sex, schemes, and sass, MacKenzie's books (The Naked Duke, 2005; The Naked Marquis, 2006; The Naked Baron, 2009) are so addictive they should come with a warning label. --Shelley Mosley</p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Diet: 4-Week Meal Plan for Beginners with Easy Recipes to Fight Inflammation and Restore Your Healthy Weight.

Inflammation and pain are simply signs that there is something wrong with our bodies. This could be an attack by pathogens, nutritional deficiency or excess accumulation of certain nutrients.

Reared on the ideal of the self-made man, American men had long rejected the need for college. But in the early twentieth century this ideal began to change as white men born in the U.S. faced a barrage of new challenges, among them a stultifying bureaucracy and growing competition in the workplace from an influx of immigrants and women. At this point a college education appealed to young men as an attractive avenue to success in a dawning corporate age. Accessible at first almost exclusively to middle-class white males, college funneled these aspiring elites toward a more comfortable and certain future in a revamped construction of the American dream.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Creating the College Man</i> Daniel A. Clark argues that the dominant mass media of the era&#x2014;popular magazines such as <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>&#x2014;played an integral role in shaping the immediate and long-term goals of this select group of men. In editorials, articles, fiction, and advertising, magazines depicted the college man as simultaneously cultured and scientific, genteel and athletic, polished and tough. Such depictions underscored the college experience in powerful and attractive ways that neatly united the incongruous strains of American manhood and linked a college education to corporate success.</p><p>Daniel A. Clark is assistant professor of history at Indiana State University.&#x201c;Examines how &#x2018;going to college&#x2019; became that quintessential middle-class experience and, moreover, how it reshaped the archetype of the American businessman for the emergent economic base of corporate capitalism.&#x201d;&#x2014; John Pettegrew, author of <i>Brutes in Suits: Male Sensibility in America, 1890-1920</i><br><br>&#x201c;A valuable contribution to the scholarship on the several areas it pulls together: the histories of popular magazines, the success ethic, business, higher education, and intercollegiate athletics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Oriard, author of <i>Reading Football: How the Popular Press Created an American Spectacle</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;[A]n engaging contribution to the history of the mass media that provides evidence of the power of magazines to shape our mental lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bookforum</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Clark&#x2019;s book is a valuable addition to the growing historical literature on the meaning and significance of higher education in America. . . .[I]t clearly and thoroughly illuminates crucial sources of popular images of college life.&nbsp; Such images remain familiar to this day and, whether we realize it or not, shape our own expectations and perceptions of what college is and should be about.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Cutting Edge</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Articulate and engaging. . . .the findings here are significant and timely, suggesting how college education acquired its democratic value and even utility, less from curricular changes than from larger norms and narratives attached to it by educators, editors, and advertisers.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Augst, <i>Journal of American History</i></p><br><br>&#x201c;The book is rich in reflections about these magazine&#x2019;s representations of college curricula and extracurricular life, and the linkages between these and both the newly developing ideals of masculinity and the world of corporate capitalism.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Historical Studies in Education</i><br></p><h2>Island Ancestors: Oceanic Art from the Masco Collection</h2><p>A catalog of an exhibition, showing paintings and ritual objects of Oceanic peoples</p><p>Allen Wardwell was formerly curator of primitive art at the Art Institute of Chicago and director of the Gallery of the Asia Society in New York.Wardwell's study will undoubtedly be of as much interest to professionals as to readers with no prior knowledge of Oceanic art. The Masco collection is composed of exceptional ceremonial objects and body adornments, figurative sculptures, and everyday utensils of exquisite workmanship. Although background information provides a better understanding of myths and religious beliefs bearing directly on much of the work's imagery, it is the author's illuminating commentaries that place each piece in an engaging context. Stunning, full-page photographs illustrate every artwork, from highly refined Easter Island forms suggesting the austere modernism of a Brancusi sculpture to intricately carved Maori objects bearing dynamic linear motifs and revealing faces that share a ferocious countenance. An exemplary addition to art collections. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Railway Maps of the World</h2><p><b>A gorgeously illustrated collection of the world's greatest railway maps and posters, historical and contemporary. </b> <br><br> <i>Transit Maps of the World</i> was an extraordinary and unexpected success and is now a cult favorite. In his irresistible follow-up Mark Ovenden has produced a mesmerizing compendium of historical and contemporary railway maps and posters from every corner of the world. Hundreds of images, covering two centuries of railway advertising, surveyors' plans, travel posters, satellite photos, and station wall maps, are combined with text brimming with vivid historical details and charming anecdotes. <br><br> Part One presents the stunning visual material chronologically, from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 to the proposed 2020 high speed networks of China. Part Two is an atlas of maps from more than one hundred countries from Algeria to Argentina to Zambia and Zimbabwe. Appendixes include a trove of factoids, track stats and information about rail operators and rail museums. <i>Railway Maps of the World</i> is a visual delight for your eyes, making it a must have for every train fanatic-armchair or ticketed-history buff, and lover of graphic design.</p><p>Born in London in 1963, Mark Ovenden evinced an early fascination with trains and TV that has remained with him over the course of his life. Following college he pursued a number of positions in local government and on the radio promoting progressive attitudes towards gay issues before getting a full time job at BBC Radio 1 as a producer. In 1998 he joined MTV as a freelance Music Programmer, where he gave birth to another production company which went on to produce shows for Atlantic252. There Mark was later taken on as a presenter of a weekly record review show with Chris Coco and as their specialist programmes producer and later breakfast newsreader. <p>When Atlantic252 closed down Mark moved to Ministry Of Sound where he helped set up their DAB station, Ibiza unit and later, as Head of Radio there, ran a popular FM version of the station. Mark moved into consultancy after this working with Purple radio and the DRG.</p> <p>In 2002 while still working in his spare time on his book project he moved to a fledgling TV channel as Channel Manager.</p> <p>Mark Ovenden's <i>Metro Maps of the World</i> was published in November 2003 to great critical acclaim. It has since been re-written and updated for the American market and is now published by Penguin as <i>Transit Maps of the World</i>.

General readers and students alike will seek out these essential works by the writer Susan Sontag referred to as an unimpeachably major voice in modern French literature.

Aaron Burr's political ambitions and treasonous activities become a wonderfully interesting and involving subplot that causes all the Gentrys much grief.

As a result, we can feel stuck or confused when it is time to transition in our work, relationships or habits. This book provides a general theory of change, why and how we get stuck, and what we can do to make a shift. Through an exploration of common obstacles, we learn to tell the truth about what is possible, identify the difference between our power and our powerlessness, and make plans to achieve a positive future. As we begin to understand how power affects our lives and relationships, we develop the knowledge we need to change. Change comes from our awareness of what we want, the choices that are available to us, and clarity about the collective forces opposing us. Our access to power arises from this knowledge, our thoughtful plans put into action, practice of new skills, and the support of our communities. Through a series of alterations in our patterns of thought, embodiment and relationships, we learn to change and thus discover compassion, satisfaction, inner peacefulness, and freedom.</p><p></p><h2>Actors on Acting: The Theories, Techniques, and Practices of the World&#39;s Great Actors, Told in Thir Own Words</h2><p>Redesigned with a contemporary new cover, this is a comprehensive consideration of all aspects of the actor&#39;s art and craft, as told by the theater&#39;s greatest practitioners, from ancient Greece to the 20th century.</p><p></p><h2>Hell&#39;s Seven (Edge #8)</h2><p>Pinnacle 1st edition 1st printing paperback vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Be Your Own Contractor: How to Build your Own Home and Save Thousands</h2><p>In this book, you will learn how to choose a building site, create a construction timeline, cost estimating, apply for a construction loan, obtain required insurance, create or buy building plans, find and negotiate with subcontractors, how to comply with building codes, inspection and permit requirements.

Her first book, <i>Family Bonds: Adoption, Infertility, and the New World of Child Reproduction</i>, was called "brilliant . . . an intelligent and passionate exploration of the legal, racial, and psychological issues" by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. The mother of three boys, two of them adopted from Peru, she lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.A disturbing look at how the lives of Americas modern-day orphans are sacrificed for the often unrealistic goal of keeping troubled families together. Bartholet (Family Bonds: Adoption and the Politics of Parenting, 1993), an expert on family law and an adoptive mother herself, traces the historical, political, and cultural reasons why battered and neglected children are far more likely to spend years in foster limbo, or be sent back to abusive homes, than to be adopted by loving families. The author charges that despite recent legislation that bars race as a factor, everyone from private foundation administrators to judges, lawyers, and bureaucrats continues to be guided by the notion that children should be cared for by relatives, or adopted by families who look like them. Back in 1972, the National Association of Black Social Workers denounced transracial adoption as a form of racial genocide. Though race-matching policies have gone underground since then, Bartholet believes they resurface in criteria like kinship and cultural competence. Because other relatives may not be up to the task of parenting, and because there are not enough minority families to adopt all the children who need them, the author asserts that race-matching essentially condemns many youngsters to lasting physical, cognitive, and emotional damage. Whereas wife beaters are treated like criminals, child abusers, often plagued by poverty and substance abuse, tend to be seen as victims themselves. Bartholet expresses sympathy for their plight but demands that social workers stop using precious child-welfare resources to prop up deeply disturbed families. What matters, she insists, is that the children get into homes where they can thrive. She also suggests, somewhat unrealistically, that the state could take a proactive role in reducing child abuse by instituting universal visitation of all families before and after birth. The author makes her case intelligently, fearlessly, and exhaustively. Curiously, since her subject matter is so wrenching, Bartholets writing lacks emotional power. Nobodys Children ultimately appeals not to the heart, but to the head. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As pastor, educator, author, editor, and politician, he was tireless in his efforts to apply the Christian faith to every department of life, and thus earned the esteem of his countrymen and the respect of many beyond the borders of Holland. He was the founder of the Free (Reformed) University of Amsterdam in 1880, and served from 1901 to 1905 as Prime Minister of the Netherlands.</p><p>(1837&#x2013;1920) He was a Reformed pastor and theologian who dominated the religious and political life of the Netherlands for nearly half a century and whose ideas continue to inspire an international school of thought. He founded the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, organized the first major Christian political party in Europe, and served as prime minister of the Netherlands. Kuyper lectured and wrote many books on Reformed theology and generally sought to show the public relevance of Christian faith to modern life.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>P-61 Black Widow Units of World War 2 (Osprey Combat Aircraft 8)</h2><p>The first aircraft to be purposely designed as a radar-equipped nightfigher, Northrop&#39;s P-61 Black Widow was heavily influenced by early RAF combat experience with radar-equipped aircraft in the years 1940/41 of World War II (1939-1945).

A book overflowing with God's grace." <p> &#x2015;<b>Nan C. Merrill</b>, author of <i>Psalms for Praying and Meditations and Mandalas</i></p><br>The visionary testimony of Joa Bolendas awakens us to the full reality of spiritual life on earth and in heaven. To be alive in God&#x2019;s world means living in a prayerful and powerful unity with God, with those risen from the dead, and all the peoples of the earth. To live this unity is truly human. The focus of the visions contained in this book is to bring awareness of the deep bonds uniting the living with each other, with the dead, and with God. <br><br> In these fragments of discourses with those risen from the dead as reported here, we experience their awakening to a new life in a greater life in God&#x2019;s world. The risen ones tell us to make God&#x2019;s kingdom alive on earth and thus release a process of great spiritual energy to guide humanity and restore the earth to its spiritual axis.</p><p><b>Joa Bolendas</b> (1917&#x2013;2005) was&nbsp;a modern Swiss visionary and down-to-earth mystic in the mold of Hildegard of Bingen. She had visions of spiritual beings throughout her adult life, beginning the 1950s. She grew up like any normal child, but it quickly became evident that she had psychic gifts. With her confirmation into the Protestant church, she became aware of God's guidance and began to have significant dreams. Her first visions concerned the unity of the multitude of different churches. The heavenly beings who came to her also spoke to her of the state of the world&#x2015;ecological, geopolitical, and social&#x2015;and asked her to pray. Thus it was that Joa undertook great prayer battles for the future of humanity and the Earth. These became known&#x2015;no one knows how&#x2015;and occasionally foreign governments would consult with her. She continued to live simply as she deepened her devotion to God and the world through profound prayer. In her later years, her visions expanded to include revelations that related to the meaning of life on both sides of the threshold. Joa Bolendas continued each week to attend various neighborhood churches for prayer, and continued to receive visions whose range and depth continued to expand. At the age of eighty-eight, she passed into God's world. Click here to visit Joa's website.<br><br><b>Therese Schroeder-Sheker</b> is a musician, medievalist, teacher, and clinician.

He has also written &#34;The Last Grain Race&#34;, &#34;Slowly Down the Ganges&#34;, &#34;Love and War in the Apennines&#34; and &#34;On the Shores of the Mediterranean&#34;.</p><p>For more than a decade following the end of World War II, Eric Newby toiled away in the British fashion industry, peddling some of the ugliest clothes on the planet. (Regarding one wafer-thin model in her runway best, he was reminded of "those flagpoles they put up in the Mall when the Queen comes home.") Fortunately, Newby reached the end his haute-couture tether in 1956. At that point, with the sort of sublime impulsiveness that's forbidden to fictional characters but endemic to real ones, he decided to visit a remote corner of Afghanistan, where no Englishman had planted his brogans for at least 50 years. What's more, he recorded his adventure in a classic narrative, <i>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</i>. The title, of course, is a fine example of Newby's habitual self-effacement, since his journey--which included a near-ascent of the 19,800-foot Mir Samir--was anything but short. And his book seems to furnish a missing link between the great Britannic wanderers of the Victorian era and such contemporary jungle nuts as Redmond O'Hanlon. <p> At times it also brings to mind Evelyn Waugh, who contributed the preface. Newby is a less acidulous writer, to be sure, and he has little interest in launching the sort of heat-seeking satiric missiles that were Waugh's specialty. Still, <i>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</i> is a hilarious read. The author excels at the dispiriting snapshot, capturing, say, the Afghan backwater of Fariman in two crisp sentences: "A whole gale of wind was blowing, tearing up the surface of the main street. Except for two policemen holding hands and a dog whose hind legs were paralysed it was deserted." His capsule history of Nuristan also gets in some sly digs at Britain's special relationship with the violence-prone Abdur Rahman: </p><blockquote> Officially his subsidy had just been increased from 12,000 to 16,000 lakhs of rupees. To the British he had fully justified their selection of him as Amir of Afghanistan and, apart from the few foibles remarked by Lord Curzon, like flaying people alive who displeased him, blowing them from the mouths of cannon, or standing them up to the neck in pools of water on the summits of high mountains and letting them freeze solid, he had done nothing to which exception could be taken. </blockquote> Newby also surpasses Waugh--and indeed, most other travel writers--in another important respect: he's miraculously free of solipsism. Even the keenest literary voyagers tend to be, in the purest sense of the term, self-centered. But <i>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</i> includes wonderfully oblique portraits of the author's travel companion, Hugh Carless, and his wife, Wanda (who plays a starring role in such subsequent chronicles as <i>Slowly down the Ganges</i>). There are also dozens of brilliant cameo parts, and an indelible record of a stunning landscape. The roof of the world is, in Newby's rendering, both an absolute heaven and a low-oxygen hell. Yet the author never pretends to pit himself against a malicious Nature--his mountains are, in Frost's memorable phrase, too lofty and original to rage. Which is yet another reason to call this little masterpiece a peak performance. <i>--James Marcus</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Skin</h2><p>As a sculptor of metal, Tess is consumed with the perfection of welds, the drip of liquid metal, addicted to the burn.

Twisted, man, as the new Abyss line plunges forward with its plan to advance through the frontiers of psychological horror. Koja fulfills Abyss's hopes with a savage hymn to industrial culture--a first hardcover whose breakthrough originality is unique but will leave many fighting off its overload. Metal sculptor Tess Bajac's days are spent scrabbling through junkyards, scraping bucks together through odd jobs as a welder, and soldering poems in steel. Unlike many in the field, who shape abstracts out of found objects, Tess does her own welding. (Koja at times follows the imitative fallacy and welds scrap sentences into Burroughs-like cutup paragraphs that mimic her heroine's sculpture. Which can be hard on the reader.) Into Tess's life creeps Bibi, a dancer turned artist in body metal, blood, burns, scars, and pain. Tess longs for motion in her sculpture. Bibi brings it, making love-dances to the sharp-edged pieces that leave her ripped and bleeding. Together with some dirty young dudes and studs who are artists in explosives and weird soundtapes and strobe lights, they form a group called the Surgeons and put on Grand Guignol horror shows that make them famous among subcultures. Then Bibi's lover Paul is killed during one show, the Surgeons fold, and Bibi splits from Tess, who desponds. Later, even more beringed through all the lips on her body, Bibi returns and seduces Tess into her first lesbian tie. But Bibi is bent and invents endless injustices on Tess's part so that she can justify more scars, pain, and body metal. A strong stylist, Koja makes white-hot the pains of metal sculpting and draws a big picture of S&amp;M bars and byways before bringing on her big show as Bibi decides to go all the way and, with razor and scalpel, just about get out of her skin--or help a friend out of his. Beyond the styptic pencil and safety blades. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This humorless novel about art punks in an unnamed present-day city is long on form and short on content. The main character, Tess Bajac, is an earnest young sculptor who lives for her work, so much so that readers may well long for her to do something besides make anther sculpture. She does all too rarely. Tess meets Bibi Bloss, a fey dancer, and they establish Surgeons of the Demolition, a performance art troupe whose shows combine Tess's mobile, menacing, robotlike constructions with Bibi's dancers and much fake blood. Koja devotes endless pages to details of their productions, and the vicissitudes of the protagonists' relationship have to suffice for drama. Their main source of conflict is Bibi's growing compulsion to mortify her flesh via piercing, tattooing and scarification. Readers will find it hard to relate to such a rarefied concern, especially since the roots of Bibi's obsession are never explored. Koja ( The Cipher ) has a considerable talent for evoking atmosphere, but her style, an obscurantist mix of stark minimalism and florid gush, further distances the characters from the reader and hampers the novel's already minimal movement. The ending is merely a jarring, long-overdue bit of business; on the whole the novel, like the art of the characters it portrays, is a sustained exercise in style over substance. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Scorpio Illusion</h2><p>After his own wife dies as a result of his lethal spy games, naval intelligence officer Tyrell Hawthorne carves out a new life for himself, but he is drawn back into the &#34;business&#34;</p><p>"Don't ever begin a Ludlum novel if you have to go to work the next day." <br>--<i>Chicago Sun Times.</i><p>"Breakneck... readablity." <br>--<i>The New York Times Book Reveiw.</i></p><p>"A high-voltage tale of drama and suspense." <br>-- <i>The Denver Post.</i></p><p></p>Amaya Bajaratt is beautiful, elusive, deadly --&nbsp;&nbsp;and she has set in motion a chilling conspiracy&nbsp;&nbsp;that a desperate government cannot stop.

In 1932 he joined his friend Learie Constantine in Britain, where he became cricket correspondent of the Manchester Guardian. A central figure in the Pan-African movement and the struggle for colonial emancipation, he returned to Trinidad in 1958 in its run-up to independence. He later went back to London, where he died in 1989.&#34;Great claims have been made for [Beyond a Boundary] since its first appearance in 1963: that it is the greatest sports book ever written; that it brings the outsider a privileged insight into West Indian culture; that it is a severe examination of the colonial condition. All are true&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;To say &#34;the best cricket book ever written&#34; is piffingly inadequate praise. A mental landscape triangulated by literature, socialism and cricket represents an ideal we should all aspire to, and this ennobling and beautifully written book should be read by anyone with the slightest interest in any one of the above&#34; * Guardian * &#34;Anyone who has not encountered [Beyond A Boundary] should seize the chance now&#34; * Sunday Telegraph * &#34;Years ago I had presumed, on being repeatedly told that C L R James&#39; Beyond A Boundary was the finest sports book ever written, that it was the opposite; in fact, James&#39; erudite tale probably warrants that label&#34; * Independent * &#34;An innovative mixture of autobiography, sports journalism and political philosophy&#34; * Daily Telegraph *</p><h2>Bee Quest</h2><p>A hunt for the world's most elusive bees leads Dave Goulson from Salisbury plain to Sussex hedgerows, from Poland to Patagonia. Whether he is tracking great yellow bumblebees in the Hebrides or chasing orchid bees through the Ecuadorian jungle, Dave Goulson&#x2019;s wit, humour and deep love of nature make him the ideal travelling companion. <p>But perhaps <i>Bee Quest</i> is most fascinating when Dave Goulson explores closer to home, amongst the secret places hidden right under our noses: the abandoned industrial estates where great crested newts roam; or the rewilded estate at Knepp Castle, where, with the aid of some hairy, bluebell-eating Tamworth pigs, nightingale song has been heard for the first time in generations.</p> <p>This utterly charming book will inspire you to think about the ways in which we are all responsible for the future of our world. Through his scientific expertise and passion for conservation, Goulson shows us nature&#x2019;s resilience against the odds, and that beauty hides in the most surprising places.</p></p><p><b>Dave Goulson</b> studied biology at Oxford University and is now Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Sussex. He has spent the last 20 years studying bumblebees, and has published over 200 scientific articles on their biology.

He also laces his stories with rich helpings of wit and humour.&#34; -- Mark Cocker * Spectator * &#34;In this delightful book [Goulson] tells us of the discoveries he has made during his `bee travels&#39;... a humorous, beautifully written tribute to these insects, and hope-filled examples of nature&#39;s resilience.&#34; * Outdoor Photography * &#34;Entomologist Dave Goulson journeyed as far as Patagonia to track down populations of the world&#39;s rarest bumblebees. The result is this fun serial travelogue and ode to diverse countryside...

That's when the devilish William Donaldson adopted the <i>nom de lettre</i> of Mr. Root and began to offer unsolicited advice, bluffly impertinent, robustly cranky, wonderfully lunatic advice, and propose strange but just-barely-plausible schemes to Britain's most prominent individuals. Donaldson's all-too-straight-talking, archly English crackpot elicited from his targeted bigwigs one unthinkingly self-important reply after another, and often a signed 8x10 glossy!

She first excelled in the exacting craft of lacquer, creating screens, panels, furniture, and objects of technical virtuosity and poetic strength. Eileen Gray then developed an interest in architecture, designing two houses, ?E-1027? (completed 1929) and ?Tempe a Pailla? (completed 1934) in the south of France, which are seminal examples of the spirit of the Modern movement.

Elected to the Hall of Fame in 1956, he was a manager by the age of twenty-six and a general manager at forty-one. He was the youngest player-manager ever to play in the World Series, and he managed the Red Sox longer than any other man in history. As president of the American League, he oversaw two expansions, four franchise shifts, and the revolutionary and controversial introduction of the designated-hitter rule, which he wrote himself.<br>&nbsp;This book follows Cronin from his humble beginnings to his position as one of the most powerful figures in baseball. Mark Armour explores Cronin&#x2019;s time as a player as well as his role in some of the game&#x2019;s fiercest controversies, from the creation of the All-Star Game to the issue of integration. Bringing to life one of baseball&#x2019;s definitive characters, this book supplies a crucial and fascinating chapter in the history of America&#x2019;s pastime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Armour is the editor <i>The Great Eight: The 1975 Cincinnati Reds</i> (Nebraska, 2014) and a coeditor of <i>Pitching, Defense, and Three-Run Homers: The 1970 Baltimore Orioles</i> (Nebraska, 2012).<br>"This is a rich account of one of the 20th century's great player-managers, his rise from modest beginnings all the way to Cooperstown, and presidency of the American League."&#x2014;Margaret Heilbrun and Gilles Renaud, <i>Library Journal</i> (Margaret Heilbrun and Gilles Renaud <i>Library Journal</i> 2010-02-01)<br><br>"Mark Armour has produced a grand and deep biography of one of the sport's central figures.

An extraordinary source of spiritual enlightenment and practical knowledge. 27 original lithographs.</p><p>Stephanie Kaza, Ph.D., teaches environmental ethics, the radical environmental movement, and ecophilosophy at the University of Vermont and the Institute for Deep Ecology.Twenty-seven lyrical, beautifully illustrated essays about communing with trees. Kaza (Environmental Studies/University of Vermont) tries to marry deep ecology with the ``Mountains and Rivers Sutra'' of the ninth-century Japanese Zen master Eihei Dogen. Like the sutra, the book progresses in five sections, beginning with the ``simple desire to meet trees and make contact'' to the desire to ``uncover more complete histories of individual trees,'' as well as to ``experience a certain vulnerability in raising difficult questions'' about life and death among trees and humans; then going, third, through an entering into the sufferings of trees and on, fourth, to a response in ways that ``are heartfelt and genuine'' and that ``aim for greater capacity in approaching the very demanding situation of trees today''; and, lastly, taking up a search for ways ``to restore spiritual as well as biological relationships with trees....'' Kaza is deeply serious as she strives for the heartfelt in trees growing up the Coast Ranges of central California, and in Washington, Oregon, and the Sierra Nevada. She fights TV and nature movies that offer ``delusional substitutes for rich, sensory contact with the actual rhythms and textures of the natural world'' (an argument very similar to Bill McKibben's in The Age of Missing Information, 1992). Hers are one- sided conversations: The redwoods, alders, maples, and oaks don't answer back. But we get many wonderful moments down in the drinking roots of sycamores; up in the spring ecstasy of pollinating maples; sitting in the still wisdom of caves; and watching a nervous Kaza, with a diamond mind and chain saw, cutting firewood that she praises. Too talky at times, but readers who stay will be rich winners. Could achieve a cult following.

Unearthing the best of the city's stunning architecture, palaces and parks, west-end musicals, world-class art galleries and museums in between, there are 3D aerial views of London's most interesting districts, cutaways and floor-plans of all the major sites, and detailed listings of the best hotels and restaurants in London for all budgets. The guide includes four 'Great Days Out' and extensive practical information including insider tips on where to find London's best shops and markets, traditional pubs and the goldmine of fun to be found for children.

(<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>), is ably conveyed in the visual burst of Dorling Kindersley's <i>London</i> guide. This compact book is filled to overflowing with a montage of timelines, street maps, 3-D aerial views, district maps, cutaways of important buildings--including Buckingham Palace and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre--and more than 1,200 full-color photographs. <p> Like all of DK's books, this reference is overwhelming when you first crack open the pages.

If you're worried about the practicalities of the trip, fear not: <i>London</i> is on your side. A section on travelers' needs and a handy survival guide--including instructions, complete with photographic aides, on how to use different types of public telephones--should eliminate any apprehension about exploring this wondrous city. Perhaps the most useful feature for those on the go who want portable information, and for those who hate to haul out maps in public ("Hey!

Beginning with the River Thames, she examines the city on the north bank, still largely confined within the old Roman walls. The wealthy lived in mansions upriver, and the royal palaces were even farther up at Westminster. On the south bank, theaters and spectacles drew the crowds, and Southwark and Bermondsey were bustling with trade. Picard examines the streets and the traffic in them; she surveys building methods and shows us the decor of the rich and the not-so-rich. Her account overflows with particulars of domestic life, right down to what was likely to be growing in London gardens.<br><br>Picard then turns her eye to the Londoners themselves, many of whom were afflicted by the plague, smallpox, and other diseases. The diagnosis was frequently bizarre and the treatment could do more harm than good. But there was comfort to be had in simple, homely pleasures, and cares could be forgotten in a playhouse or the bull-baiting and bear-baiting rings, or watching a good cockfight. The more sober-minded might go to hear a lecture at Gresham College or the latest preacher at Paul's Cross.<br><br>Immigrants posed problems for Londoners who, though proud of their nation's religious tolerance, were concerned about the damage these skilled migrants might do to their own livelihoods, despite the dominance of livery companies and their apprentice system. Henry VIII's destruction of the monasteries had caused a crisis in poverty management that was still acute, resulting in begging (with begging licenses!) and a "parochial poor rate" paid by the better-off. <br><br>Liza Picard's wonderfully vivid prose enables us to share the satisfaction and delights, as well as the vexations and horrors, of the everyday lives of the denizens of sixteenth-century London.<br></p><p><p>Praise for ELIZABETH'S LONDON:<br>"Wisely, she parcels out her findings in units that seldom come to more than one to three pages...there is an excellent index, a handy means of dealing with treasure that is piled high...You can open the book and start reading anywhere" --Richard Buell, Boston Globe<br>"Lively guide to Elizabethan England." -The Washington Post </p><p>Praise for DR.

Reprint.</p><p>Tom Miller has been writing about Latin America and the American Southwest for more than four decades. His highly praised books include <i>Trading with the Enemy</i> and <i>Revenge of the Saguaro</i>, and his articles have appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, <i>LIFE</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and<i> Natural History</i>, among other outlets. He is affiliated with the University of Arizona&#x2019;s Center for Latin American Studies, and at a 2008 ceremony, the City of Quito proclaimed Miller Un Hu�sped Ilustre (An Illustrious Guest).Though offering perhaps more about Panama hats than the reader might ever want to know, this is a satisfying travel book that tells much else about Ecuador and its peoples. The growing, harvesting, and processing of straw, the weaving of it, the finishing of the hats, exportation, and all the bartering along the way is the glue that holds this book together. Visiting the countryside and towns such as Quito, Guayaquil, Lago Agrio, and Jipijapa ("among the ugliest towns south of the equator"), Miller tells us, among other things, about the Indians and their sad centuries-long plight, expatriates, illegal Ecuadorian emigration to the United States, precarious third-class Andean bus trips, the small Jewish community, and a wild and tragic Corpus Christi fiesta.

She was the only woman to translate the entire Bible, but her work has been alternately ignored or disparaged by subsequent biblical scholars. This is in part because no English translation other than the King James Version attracted significant attention until the appearance of the Revised Standard Version in 1952.In With Her Own Eyes, Emily Sampson argues that Smith&#x2019;s work anticipated trends followed by later, usually male, translators and that she deserves recognition as a pioneering and influential biblical scholar in her own right. Smith was the daughter of a preacher and lawyer and a mother who wrote poetry and studied linguistics, mathematics, and astronomy. When William Miller&#x2019;s predictions of the end of the world failed, she began translating for herself from the original languages. Trained in Greek and Latin, Smith taught herself Hebrew and ultimately produced five translations. In 1876 Smith published a very literal translation at her own expense. She hoped not only that her Bible would reveal additions made to the King James Version but that her work would help bolster the case that women were, in many respects, the equal of men. Sampson also details Smith&#x2019;s striking personal history. She and her four sisters were seen as eccentrics in the small town of Glastonbury. They were active in the abolitionist movement in the decades before the Civil War and later in the temperance and women&#x2019;s suffrage movements. Smith attended the first meeting of the Association of the Advancement of Women, and she and her sister Abby became famous in Connecticut for their refusal to pay taxes until given the right to vote in town meetings.A comprehensive look at the intellectual, social, and political circles of Julia Smith, With Her Own Eyes is a singular portrait of one of the most remarkable autodidacts in the history of American intellectual life.</p><p>Emily Sampson teaches in the Humanities Department at Cuyamaca College in California.</p><h2>The Mapping of Love and Death. by Jacqueline Winspear</h2><p>August 1914. When war in Europe is declared, a young American cartographer, Michael Clifton, is compelled to fight for his father&#39;s native country, and sets sail for England to serve in the British Army. Three years later, he is listed as missing in action. April 1932. After Michael&#39;s remains are unearthed in a French field, his devastated parents engage investigator Maisie Dobbs, hoping she can find the unnamed nurse whose love letters were among their late son&#39;s belongings. It is a quest that leads Maisie back to her own bittersweet wartime love - and to the discovery that Michael Clifton may not have died in combat. Suddenly an exposed web of intrigue and violence threatens to ensnare the dead soldier&#39;s family and even Maisie herself as she attempts to cope with the impending loss of her mentor and the unsettling awareness that she is once again falling in love.</p><p><strong>Alexander McCall Smith Talks with Jacqueline Winspear</strong> <br><br><strong>Alexander McCall Smith</strong>: Characters, once created, have a way of staying on. Maisie is an attractive character--when did she say to you: "I want a series?"<br><br><strong>Jacqueline Winspear</strong>: As I was writing the first novel in the series, <em>Maisie Dobbs</em>, I realized that scenes and ideas were coming to me that were not part of the book. I started keeping notes on those other scenes, passages of dialogue and so on, and when I had finished <em>Maisie Dobbs</em>, I went through those notes and realized I had rough plans for another five or six books. Indeed, as I was writing the second book in the series, <em>Birds of a Feather</em>, I really had to push any thoughts of the intended third novel from my mind, so strong were the images for <em>Pardonable Lies</em> that kept popping into my mind's eye. I had to be very disciplined not to be distracted by those images--it was rather like being nagged by one's own characters.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Smith</strong>: Maisie Dobbs is firmly placed in the past. Would you be comfortable writing about contemporary Britain?<br><br><strong>Winspear</strong>: That&#x2019;s a very good question, and indeed, I have a more contemporary novel on the proverbial "back-burner."&nbsp; However, although I visit my parents in Sussex many several times each year, for me there is a certain detachment from everyday life in the UK. I am not as familiar with various aspects of life there, so it might be difficult to get that ring of authenticity.&nbsp; On the other hand, one could argue that the lack of transparency could act in my favor, because I now take notice of so many things that might have passed me by.&nbsp; I believe one of the reasons I am so comfortable writing about the past is that when I was a child we lived in a small hamlet with very few children, so it was a world of adults, many of them elderly, and all of them ready to tell a story of their own youth. <br><br>I have always been drawn to the past through family history, a curiosity that has its roots in my grandfather's experience in the Great War--he was wounded and shell-shocked at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Even as a very young child I understood the extent of his suffering and struggled to fathom how something so terrible could happen to a beloved grandparent.&nbsp; And I am sure my interest in the women of that generation--the first generation of women to go to war in modern times--is rooted in memories of the ladies of a certain age who lived in our neighborhood as I was growing up. They were typical of that generation, very independent women who had remained single due to circumstance, for the men they might have married had been lost to war.<br><br>So, to the question of writing about contemporary Britain--I think I'll find out more about my level of comfort with modern times when I pull that contemporary novel off the back burner. In the meantime, there's so much that I want to explore from the past, though when I immerse myself in the preparatory research for my books, I am always reminded of the old adage: "history repeats itself."<br><br><strong>Smith</strong>: You and I both started as novelists rather later than is perhaps usual. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<br><br><strong>Winspear</strong>: When I was sixteen I rather precociously announced that I would write my first novel by the time I was thirty--it seemed such a formidable age of adulthood, I suppose. Of course, thirty came and went with no novel to show for it, and in the meantime I was becoming more and more interested in nonfiction writing.&nbsp; I was in my late thirties by the time I made a real commitment to getting my work published, and I concentrated more on essays, articles and other creative nonfiction. I believe my writing at that time represented something of an apprenticeship in that I was really working at the craft of writing, of building my understanding of framing a scene, of bringing the reader along with metaphor, and with developing scenes that were something like the literary equivalent of a zoom lens on the camera; I was trying to find out what worked in terms of drawing the reader in and placing them at the center of the action. Though I had no plans to write a novel until the idea for <em>Maisie Dobbs</em> actually came to me, upon reflection it seems as if I had been preparing for the task with my literary cross-training in the same way that an athlete prepares for the big event.&nbsp; <br><br>I believe the journey to becoming a writer is one that is very personal to the individual and is neither good or bad--it's just what it is. There are times when I think it would have been so much more fun to have started writing fiction earlier, but had that happened, the stars might not have aligned to bring the character of Maisie Dobbs into my life.&nbsp; And I think that in embarking upon being novelists in our middle years, we&#x2019;ve probably both brought something to our work that we might not have been able to offer in younger days, either due to other responsibilities, or simply who we were at the time (though having said that, I am sure your readers wish the wonderful Precious Ramotswe had been created many years before you decided to write <em>The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</em>!)<br><br><strong>Smith</strong>: Have you written anything about Maisie that you would like to unwrite?<br><br><strong>Winspear</strong>: No, not at all, although I should add that I have never gone back and re-read any of my books, a prospect I find rather daunting.&nbsp; Of course, I dip back into the books to check a point here and there, but I have never read the books from beginning to end--if I had done so, I might have a whole list of things that cause me to shudder.<br><br><strong>Smith</strong>: Do you think that transplanting oneself--in your case from the UK to California--helps one as a writer?<br><br><strong>Winspear</strong>: Another very good question!&nbsp; Many years ago, during a visit to New York, I went along to an exhibit at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue--it was called "Writers in Exile."&nbsp; The focus was on writers who lived in a place other than the land of their birth, "by will, or by compunction." I spent ages going around the exhibit taking copious notes, and remember it left me with a real sense of the power of being transplanted, whether by one&#x2019;s own choice, or by circumstance; and I have to say, I often think of it when people ask me if being here in California contributes to my work as a writer--and it does. To give an example, I can immerse myself in the time and place about which I write--Britain from the Great War on up to the 1930s--and I am not distracted by British life as it is today. Yes, of course, there is contemporary life here in California, but it is different (the way people speak, interact, shop, travel, work, etc.) so I can draw a firm line between life here and the world about which I write.&nbsp; I should confess that one of my recent challenges came when I started writing <em>The Mapping of Love and Death</em>. The opening is set in California in 1914, so I had to ensure that my knowledge of that region today did not seep into the story. To that end I immersed myself in old books about the region, and managed to procure some vintage photographs to pin on the wall so that the past was very much with me as I wrote.<br><br>When I write, the time and place of my imagination becomes very distilled, very sharp in my mind's eye. In terms of the series featuring Maisie Dobbs, it has definitely helped to be living here; when I sit down at my desk to write, I step from my world into her world, and I&#x2019;m aware of nothing else until I stop writing.&nbsp; And when I drag myself back from a morning spent in the smog-enveloped London of the 1930s, it's not bad to be able to walk outside into the garden and warm my bones in the California sun for a while.<br><br> <br><p>August 1914. As Michael Clifton is mapping land he has just purchased in California's beautiful Santa Ynez Valley, war is declared in Europe&#x2014;and duty-bound to his father's native country, the young cartographer soon sets sail for England to serve in the British army.

It is the story of two hard-boiled cops who dare to cross the thin and dangerous line that separates good and evil as they risk their lives to investigate the suspicious death of one of their own.<br><br>Sorry. The single word was written on the mirror. In front of it hung the body of Andy Fallon, a Minneapolis Internal Affairs cop. Was it suicide? Or a kinky act turned tragic accident?&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, his death wasn't a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation will be a formality, a duty that veteran Homicide detective Sam Kovac isn't looking forward to. He doesn't want to spend any more time than he has to in the bleak, empty world of the victim's father, Iron Mike, Kovac's old mentor and a department legend. It's too much like looking into his own future. But Kovac has a sixth sense for crime, and it's burning.<br><br>Together with his partner, the wisecracking, ambitious Nikki Liska, Kovac begins to dig at the too-neat edges of Fallon's death, uncovering one motive and one suspect after another.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of suspicion fall deeply not only on the city's power elite, but into the very heart of the police department itself.<br><br>But Fallon's death has been officially ruled an accident, and the department brass want the case to go away. Iron Mike, gunned down in the line of duty twenty years earlier and forced to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, has suffered enough, they say.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would much rather have the publicity spotlight remain on their latest legend, retiring Captain Ace Wyatt, who is headed for the bright lights of Hollywood.<br><br>Unfortunately, neither Kovac nor Liska believe Fallon died by his own hand--accidentally or otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the case unfolds, it seems more and more likely that his death is somehow tied to his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether he was killed for a case two months old--the murder of a gay patrol officer--or a case twenty years closed--the one that left his father a paraplegic and made Ace Wyatt a hero.<br><br>As Kovac and Liska dig deeper, they find their careers and lives on the line, because a killer wants the truth left dead and buried. Ashes to ashes. <b>Dust to dust.</b></p><p>Minneapolis has more than its share of interesting cops (Lucas Davenport of the John Sandford thrillers, for one), and Tami Hoag's homicide dicks, Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska, join the club in this thoughtful and surprisingly moving novel of dirty cops and cover-ups. Internal Affairs investigator Andy Fallon is a suicide--or is he? The word around the department is that Andy, son of Iron Mike Fallon, an old hero of Sam's, killed himself because Mike turned his back on him when Andy told him he was gay. Or maybe it was because a lover dumped him, or even (snicker, snicker) a perverted sexual practice gone wrong. That's the gossip, but Sam feels he owes it to Mike to investigate. <p> Sam is a familiar type in this genre, and his self-awareness is almost painful at times. "You're a stereotype. The tragic hero," he's told by Amanda Savard, the strong-but-vulnerable Internal Affairs lieutenant whose determination to keep the Fallon case closed foreshadows her personal history. "The twice-divorced, smoking, drinking workaholic," Sam agrees. "I don't know what's heroic about that. It reeks of failure to me, but maybe I have unrealistic standards." But Sam's droll sense of humor is matched by his deeply ingrained crap detector. When Iron Mike apparently kills himself too, you can almost feel its needle vibrate. Then Sam and Nikki open another closed case, this one almost two decades old, and find the connections that threaten to unravel past crimes and future promises. Hoag is a writer very much in command of her craft: the pacing excels, the characters are complex and interesting, and the details well worked out. Readers will look forward to another Kovac and Liska adventure. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Tami Hoag is...<br><br>"One of the hottest names <br>In the suspense game."<br>--<i>People</i><br><br>"Without a doubt...One of the most intense suspense writers around." <br>--<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"The Queen Of The Crime Story."<br>--<i>New York Post</i><br><br></p><h2>Thomas Wilfred&#39;s Clavilux</h2><p>This anthology brings together the few essays on Lumia that were published during Thomas Wilfred&#39;s lifetime.

Writing with wit and passion and in engrossing detail, Richard Meier takes us behind the scenes of the thirteen-year-long, one-billion-dollar project.<br><br>We follow Meier from 1957 when, just out of Cornell, he traveled to Europe for a grand tour and to seek work with two of his architectural heroes, Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto, and through to his early years in New York with Marcel Breuer. After Meier established his own private practice, we see him designing public housing and the private houses that expressed his distinctive modernist style of pure geometric line, of whiteness, and open spaces flooded with light. We also see him, in time, designing such important art centers as the Museum of Decorative Arts in Frankfurt, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona.<br><br>And then--in 1984--the Getty Center. Meier tells us how he was selected from more than thirty architects, after a lengthy and involved series of interviews, to design the cultural campus on the spectacular 110-acre site overlooking the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The Getty was a new cultural institution, and Meier worked with the program directors to design the buildings that would serve them best. In the beginning, neither he nor the Getty had any idea of the complications in store for them. Each of the Center's six components, including the Getty Museum, had its own set of priorities. Meier faced two important contradictory challenges: the creative and the practical. His task was to design a series of buildings that would stand as architectural masterpieces. But, at the same time, he had to deal with myriad specific demands and limitations imposed not only by his client, but also by the local homeowners, who were alarmed by the specter of a vast complex arising in their midst. As a result, the design process itself was not completed until 1991, when the drawings and large-scale model of the Center were finally unveiled to the press.<br><br>But Meier's task had scarcely begun. The sheer scale and complexity of the project, and the number of people involved in every decision, continued to mean constant revisions. As construction moved ahead, Meier lived on the site, yet commuted to his New York office to manage ongoing European projects, while in his new office in Los Angeles, the population of architects handling the Getty grew to more than a hundred. Although the Center's design had been agreed on, much negotiation lay ahead before questions of material, color, and landscaping were at last settled.<br><br>Finally, in 1996, almost half of the Center was ready to be occupied, and Meier could see that the work--carried out by the many architects, engineers, technicians, craftsmen, and builders for thirteen years--was well on its way to being completed. Meier's fascinating book, chronicling the creation of one of the cultural monuments of our time, is a unique record of the art and process of building in this century, and an important contribution to architectural history.</p><p>Richard Meier's Getty Center complex in Los Angeles, thirteen years in the making, is the subject of this autobiographical account of what has been frequently called "the architectural commission of the century." Meier has the perfect authorial voice, admirably straddling the personal and the professional with aplomb and understated flair. He opens with a straightforward account of his youthful interest in art and architecture, his basement studio in his parents' suburban new Jersey home, his education at Cornell, and his post-graduation European tour, where he unsuccessfully hounded Le Corbusier for an unpaid apprenticeship and failed to track down Alvar Aalto, another hero. His first "published" house was one commissioned by his parents; his first "freestanding work" was an $11,000 pre-fab Long Island home that was later sold to Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks. "Now I often wonder how it is that my architecture came to acquire what for many people is its singular style: this image of a perennially gleaming white building flooded with light," he writes. The rest of the book, which is punctuated by black-and-white documentary photographs, is Meier's well-crafted, detailed account of the Getty commission, including subtle descriptions of the politics involved in all aspects of its design, siting, landscaping, and daily use. It's all here: the immensity of siting the multi-building complex in the mountains overlooking the Pacific, the hundreds of architects who came to work on the project, and the craftsmen and contractors and construction crews who made it a user-friendly reality as well as a stunning modernist masterwork. Meier calmly takes the reader through the maze of issues and construction phases. Few architecture books could be more educational, or more gracefully written. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>This book provides a fascinating history of the planning, design, and construction of the six-building Getty Center in Los Angeles, one of the great cultural complexes to be built in our time. Writing with wit and passion, Richard Meier takes us behind the scenes of the thirteen-year-long, one-billion-dollar project.</p><h2>Romita LegacyDF ROMITA LEGACY HC ALEX ROSS COVER</h2><p>While Steve Ditko and Stan Lee may have created Spider-Man, it was John Romita Sr. who defined him... <br>Romita came to the book as a replacement for Steve Ditko, bringing his clean, romantic style of illustration to the book. Romita once expected Ditko to return to the book within a few months and when he didn't, history was truly made. <br>A history that is now fully explored by writer Tom Spurgeon and this presentation of the definitive book - lavishly illustrated with classic and unseen art -- starring Jazzy John Romita! From his days before Marvel, through the Sliver Age, and his days designing and creating the characters we know and love still today (including Wolverine, the Punisher and many, many more), Romita: Generations covers it all. Spurgeon's exhaustive interview includes not only Romita Sr., but the second beloved artist in the family, John Romita Jr.! <br>About Tom Spurgeon<br>Tom Spurgeon is one of North America's best-known experts on the comic strip and comic book art forms and the industries that service them. The son of a newspaperman in East Central Indiana, Tom and his brothers helped their father select new strips for the paper's comic-book page, making the Muncie Star-Press one of the first publications to carry "Calvin and Hobbes" and "The Far Side," as well as sone of the few to carry "Rudy."<br>After receiving a broad education at Washington and Lee University and a focused one at Garrett seminary on the campus of Northwestern University, Tom worked briefly for QVC, Inc. Drawing on experience in his nepotism-fueled career as a beat writer, editor and entertainment reporter, Tom in 1994 took the position of managing editor at The Comics Journal in Seattle, Washington. <br>Tom edited the Journal for five years, first as managing editor and then as executive editor. During that time, the magazine won multiple industry awards, increased its focus on world comics and encouraged the comics community to see small press and mini-comics as legitimate artistic outlets rather than a training ground for traditionally published works. In forcing the magazine to build on the breadth and depth of its coverage, Tom helped improve the magazine's general mainstream profile as one of American Arts' most unique and valuable publications. When literary comics began to make a major impact in the late 1990s, the Journal was the gateway publication for many editors and writers to understand the phenomenon. Tom also edited the magazine's infamous "Stan Lee issue" (October 1995) and helped launch its popular companion Web site. <br>In 1999, Tom left the magazine to become a freelancer. He remains a columnist, reviewer and occasional newsman for the publication he previously edited. He has written about comics and a variety of arts-related subjects for Suck.com, Feed, The Stranger, and more than a dozen newspapers and regional magazines. From 1999 to 2002, he wrote the critically lauded newspaper comic strip "Wildwood," which enjoyed a daily presence in more than 18 million homes. He currently lives in Silver City, New Mexico. <br></p><p></p><h2>Gertrude Jekyll on Gardening</h2><p>Selections from the British garden designer&#39;s writings provide a month-by-month guide to garden care and landscape design</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Glycemic Index Weight Loss, 2nd Edition</h2><p><b> A fully updated and expanded edition of a weight loss program that readers can count on. </b> <br><br> This fully updated and expanded edition clearly explains just how and why a glycemic index diet works by showing readers how to eat the right kind of foods-more complex carbohydrates, fiber, grains, and fruit. <br><br> �The glycemic index diet is a solution for many people at risk for Type II diabetes or those with insulin-sensitivity or resistance <br><br> �Includes information on supplements, easy recipes, food lists, and sample meal plans <br><br> �Includes an appendix with glycemic index counts and loads for all sorts of food <br><br> �Features a new study on how eating certain foods cold can make a big difference <br><br></p><p><b>Lucy Beale</b> is a weight-loss expert and coach, the creator of the bestselling CD and speaking series <i>Be Thin in Body, Mind &amp; Spirit</i>, and the author of <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide(r) to Weight Loss</i>, among others books. <b>Joan Clark-Werner, M.S., R.D., C.D.E.</b>, is a clinical dietitian at the University of Utah Hospital and Clinic.<br><br></p><h2>Jack London: Biography, A</h2><p>"The Call of the Wild" was not only a book by Jack London. It may very well have been his own personal credo, as Daniel Dyer makes clear in this gripping biography of the famed author and adventurer.<br><br>While researching Jack London, biographer Daniel Dryer uncovered an amazing truth - that London's real life was just as rich and exciting as the stories and characters he created.<br><br>Equally adept in writing as he was at thrill-seeking, London left school at age eleven to begin his lifelong courtship of adventure. He worked as a seal hunter, an oyster pirate, and a factory worker. And by the time of the Klondike gold rush, he was well on his way to becoming one of the world's most popular writers.

Whether it's an executive nursing a quiet ulcer in the boardroom or a wailing child holding a skinned knee on the playground, this uniquely unpleasant signal must be important; if it weren't, we could more easily ignore it. Neurosurgeon Frank T. Vertosick Jr. explains the evolutionary, physiological, and psychological reasons for pain in <i>Why We Hurt: The Natural History of Pain</i>. Not a paean to despair, the book helps to ease suffering through understanding and learning just how far we've come in the short history of palliative practice. Vertosick's long experience working with sufferers of hideously intractable pain, and his own long battle with migraine, provides depth and illustrative stories that draw the reader into what might otherwise be dry medicalese.<p> It's heartening to see more surgeons like Dr. Vertosick coming to accept the often-strong psychological basis of pain and appropriate nonsurgical, nonpharmacologic treatments for it. Certainly, as in the case of the woman whose trigeminal nerve was eroded by a circulatory tangle, cutting and suturing have their appropriate place. And the author found several years ago that simple acetaminophen was all he needed to stave off his headaches. His gentle explanations and usually uplifting stories help us prepare for our own episodes of suffering. Though it might seem like small comfort, learning <i>Why We Hurt</i> can be as powerful as the strongest narcotic, with no side effects. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"Fascinating insight into the greatest mystery of all: what it means to be human."&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times</i><br><br>Although medical science has made brilliant progress over the last century, we have yet to conquer, or even fully comprehend, pain. And as much as we fear pain, it remains curiously indispensable. A skilled writer and a compassionate physician, Dr. Frank Vertosick explores this paradox in <i>Why We Hurt</i>, an expertly researched and movingly told study of pain. By sharing case studies of his patients and numerous cultural and medical anecdotes, Vertosick explains the biological nature of pain, its psychological toll, and the myriad strategies we have devised to combat it. From childbirth to angina, arthritis to carpal tunnel syndrome, he puts a human face on suffering and "transmutes the lugubrious subject of pain into a provocative and edifying treatise that tightly engages the reader" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).<br><br>"[Vertosick] tells personal anecdotes about his own migraines and crafts stories of emergency room horrors with a deft sense of suspense and timing. [He] is writing for a wide audience, and at least in part for chronic-pain sufferers he ends with an inspirational flourish of advice."&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Fascinating . . . Falls squarely in the territory of Oliver Sacks."&#x2014;<i>Newsday</i><br></p><h2>The Childhood of Jesus</h2><p>After crossing oceans, a man and a boy arrive in a new land. Here they are each assigned a name and an age, and held in a camp in the desert while they learn Spanish, the language of their new country. As Simon and David they make their way to the relocation centre in the city of Novilla, where officialdom treats them politely but not necessarily helpfully.<br>&nbsp;<br>Simon finds a job in a grain wharf. The work is unfamiliar and backbreaking, but he soon warms to his stevedore comrades, who during breaks conduct philosophical dialogues on the dignity of labour, and generally take him to their hearts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now he must set about his task of locating the boy's mother. Though like everyone else who arrives in this new country he seems to be washed clean of all traces of memory, he is convinced he will know her when he sees her. And indeed, while walking with the boy in the countryside Simon catches sight of a woman he is certain is the mother, and persuades her to assume the role.<br>&nbsp;<br>David's new mother comes to realise that he is an exceptional child, a bright, dreamy boy with highly unusual ideas about the world. But the school authorities detect a rebellious streak in him and insist he be sent to a special school far away. His mother refuses to yield him up, and it is Simon who must drive the car as the trio flees across the mountains.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>The Childhood of Jesus </i>is a profound, beautiful and continually surprising novel from a very great writer.</p><p>J.

Centro de Reubicaci�n Novilla, says the sign. Reubicaci�n: what does that mean? Not a word he has learned. The office is large and empty. Hot too &#x2013; even hotter than outside. ?tioned by panes of frosted glass. Against the wall is an array of filing drawers in varnished wood. Suspended over one of the partitions is a sign: Reci�n Llegados, the words stencilled in black on a rectangle of cardboard. The clerk behind the counter, a young woman, greets him with a smile. &#x2018;Good day,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We are new arrivals.&#x2019; He articulates the words slowly, in the Spanish he has worked hard to master. &#x2018;I am looking for employment, also for a place to live.&#x2019; He grips the boy under the armpits and lifts him so that she can see him properly. &#x2018;I have a child with me.&#x2019; The girl reaches out to take the boy&#x2019;s hand. &#x2018;Hello, young man!&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;He is your grandson?&#x2019; &#x2018;Not my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him.&#x2019; &#x2018;A place to live.&#x2019; She glances at her papers. &#x2018;We have a room free here at the Centre that you can use while you look for something better. It won&#x2019;t be luxurious, but perhaps you won&#x2019;t mind that. As for employment, let us explore that in the morning &#x2013; you look tired, I am sure you want to rest. Have you travelled far?&#x2019; &#x2018;We have been on the road all week. We have come from Belstar, from the camp. Are you familiar with Belstar?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes, I know Belstar well. I came through Belstar myself. Is that where you learned your Spanish?&#x2019; &#x2018;We had lessons every day for six weeks.&#x2019; &#x2018;Six weeks? You are lucky. I was in Belstar for three months. I almost perished of boredom. The only thing that kept me going was the Spanish lessons. Did you by any chance have se�ora Pi�era as a teacher?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, our teacher was a man.&#x2019; He hesitates. &#x2018;May I raise a different matter? My boy&#x2019; &#x2013; he glances at the child &#x2013; &#x2018;is not well. Partly it is because he is upset, confused and upset, and hasn&#x2019;t been eating prop?erly. He found the food in the camp strange, didn&#x2019;t like it. Is there anywhere we can get a proper meal?&#x2019; &#x2018;How old is he?&#x2019; &#x2018;Five. That is the age he was given.&#x2019; &#x2018;And you say he is not your grandson.&#x2019; &#x2018;Not my grandson, not my son. We are not related. Here&#x2019; &#x2013; he takes the two passbooks from his pocket and proffers them. She inspects the passbooks. &#x2018;These were issued in Belstar?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. That is where they gave us our names, our Spanish names.&#x2019; She leans over the counter. &#x2018;David &#x2013; that&#x2019;s a nice name,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Do you like your name, young man?&#x2019; The boy regards her levelly but does not reply. What does she see? A slim, pale-faced child wearing a woollen coat buttoned to the throat, grey shorts covering his knees, black lace-up boots over woollen socks, and a cloth cap at a slant. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you find those clothes very hot? Would you like to take off your coat?&#x2019; The boy shakes his head. He intervenes. &#x2018;The clothes are from Belstar. He chose them himself, from what they had to offer. He has become quite attached to them.&#x2019; &#x2018;I understand. I asked because he seemed a bit warmly dressed for a day like today. Let me mention: we have a depository here at the Centre where people donate clothing that their children have outgrown. It is open every morning on weekdays. You are welcome to help yourself. You will find more variety than at Belstar.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Also, once you have filled in all the necessary forms you can draw money on your passbook. You have a settlement allowance of four hundred reals. The boy too. Four hundred each.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Now let me show you to your room.&#x2019; She leans across and whis?pers to the woman at the next counter, the counter labelled Trabajos. The woman pulls open a drawer, rummages in it, shakes her head. &#x2018;A slight hitch,&#x2019; says the girl. &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t seem to have the key to your room. It must be with the building supervisor. The supervisor&#x2019;s name is se�ora Weiss. Go to Building C. I will draw you a map. When you find se�ora Weiss, ask her to give you the key to C-55. Tell her that Ana from the main office sent you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be easier to give us another room?&#x2019; &#x2018;Unfortunately C-55 is the only room that is free.&#x2019; &#x2018;And food?&#x2019; &#x2018;Food?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. Is there somewhere we can eat?&#x2019; &#x2018;Again, speak to se�ora Weiss. She should be able to help you.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank you. One last question: Are there organizations here that specialize in bringing people together?&#x2019; &#x2018;Bringing people together?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes. There must surely be many people searching for family members. Are there organizations that help to bring families together &#x2013; families, friends, lovers?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, I&#x2019;ve never heard of such an organization.&#x2019; Partly because he is tired and disoriented, partly because the map the girl has sketched for him is not clear, partly because there are no signposts, it takes him a long time to find Building C and the office of se�ora Weiss. The door is closed. He knocks. There is no reply. He stops a passer-by, a tiny woman with a pointy, mouse-like face wearing the chocolate-coloured uniform of the Centre. &#x2018;I am looking for se�ora Weiss,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;She&#x2019;s off,&#x2019; says the young woman, and when he does not understand:: &#x2018;Off for the day. Come back in the morning.&#x2019; &#x2018;Then perhaps you can help us. We are looking for the key to room C-55.&#x2019; The young woman shakes her head. &#x2018;Sorry, I don&#x2019;t handle keys.&#x2019; They make their way back to the Centro de Reubicaci�n. The door is locked. He raps on the glass. There is no sign of life inside. He raps again. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m thirsty,&#x2019; whines the boy. &#x2018;Hang on just a little longer,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;I will look for a tap.&#x2019; The girl, Ana, appears around the side of the building. &#x2018;Were you knocking?&#x2019; she says. Again he is struck: by her youth, by the health and freshness that radiate from her. &#x2018;Se�ora Weiss seems to have gone home,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Is there not something you can do? Do you not have a &#x2013; what do you call it? &#x2013; a llave universal to open our room?&#x2019; &#x2018;Llave maestra. There is no such thing as a llave universal. If we had a llave universal all our troubles would be over. No, se�ora Weiss is the only one with a llave maestra for Building C. Do you perhaps have a friend who can put you up for the night? Then you can come back in the morning and speak to se�ora Weiss.&#x2019; &#x2018;A friend who can put us up? We arrived on these shores six weeks ago, since when we have been living in a tent in a camp out in the desert. How can you expect us to have friends here who will put us up?&#x2019; Ana frowns. &#x2018;Go to the main gate,&#x2019; she orders. &#x2018;Wait for me outside the gate. I will see what I can do.&#x2019; They pass through the gate, cross the street, and sit down in the shade of a tree. The boy nestles his head on his shoulder. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m thirsty,&#x2019; he complains. &#x2018;When are you going to find a tap?&#x2019; &#x2018;Hush,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Listen to the birds.&#x2019; They listen to the strange birdsong, feel the strange wind on their skins. Ana emerges. He stands up and waves. The boy gets to his feet too, arms stiffly by his sides, thumbs clenched in his fists. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve brought some water for your son,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Here, David, drink.&#x2019; The child drinks, gives the cup back to her. She puts it in her bag. &#x2018;Was that good?&#x2019; she asks. &#x2018;Yes.&#x2019; &#x2018;Good. Now follow me. It&#x2019;s quite a walk, but you can look on it as exercise.&#x2019; Swiftly she strides along the track across the parkland. An attrac�tive young woman, no denying that, though the clothes she wears hardly become her: a dark, shapeless skirt, a white blouse tight at the throat, flat shoes. By himself he might be able to keep up with her, but with the child in his arms he cannot. He calls out: &#x2018;Please &#x2013; not so fast!&#x2019; She ignores him. At an ever-increasing distance he follows her across the park, across a street, across a second street. Before a narrow, plain-looking house she pauses and waits. &#x2018;This is my place,&#x2019; she says. She unlocks the front door. &#x2018;Follow me.&#x2019; She leads them down a dim corridor, through a back door, down rickety wooden stairs, into a small yard overgrown with grass and weeds, enclosed on two sides by a wooden fence and on the third by chain-link wire. &#x2018;Have a seat,&#x2019; she says, indicating a rusty cast-iron chair half covered in grass. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll get you something to eat.&#x2019; He has no wish to sit. He and the boy wait by the door. The girl re-emerges bearing a plate and a pitcher. The pitcher holds water. The plate holds four slices of bread spread with margarine. It is exactly what they had for breakfast at the charity station. &#x2018;As a new arrival you are legally required to reside in approved lodgings, or else at the Centre,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;But it will be all right if you spend your first night here. Since I am employed at the Centre, we can argue that my home counts as approved lodging.&#x2019; &#x2018;That&#x2019;s very kind of you, very generous,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;There are some leftover building materials in that corner.&#x2019; She points. &#x2018;You can make yourself a shelter, if you like. Shall I leave you to it?&#x2019; He stares at her, nonplussed. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not sure I understand,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;Where exactly will we be spending the night?&#x2019; &#x2018;Here.&#x2019; She indicates the yard. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll come back in a while and see how you are getting on.&#x2019; The building materials in question are half a dozen sheets of galva�nized iron, rusted through in places &#x2013; old roofing, no doubt &#x2013; and some odds and ends of timber. Is this a test? Does she really mean that he and the child should sleep out in the open? He waits for her prom�ised return, but she does not come. He tries the back door: it is locked. He knocks; there is no response. What is going on? Is she behind the curtains, watching to see how he will react? They are not prisoners. It would be an easy matter to scale the wire fence and make off. Is that what they should do; or should he wait and see what will happen next? He waits. By the time she reappears the sun is setting. &#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t done much,&#x2019; she remarks, frowning. &#x2018;Here.&#x2019; She hands him a bottle of water, a hand towel, a roll of toilet paper; and, when he looks at her questioningly: &#x2018;No one will see you.&#x2019; &#x2018;I have changed my mind,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We will go back to the Centre. There must be a public room where we can spend the night.&#x2019; &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t do that. The gates at the Centre are closed. They close at six.&#x2019; Exasperated, he strides over to the stack of roofing, drags out two sheets, and leans them at an angle against the wooden fence. He does the same with third and fourth sheets, making a rude lean-to. &#x2018;Is that what you have in mind for us?&#x2019; he says, turning to her. But she is gone. &#x2018;This is where we are going to sleep tonight,&#x2019; he tells the boy. &#x2018;It will be an adventure.&#x2019; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x2019; says the boy. &#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t eaten your bread.&#x2019; &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like bread.&#x2019; &#x2018;Well, you will have to get used to it, because that is all there is. Tomorrow we will find something better.&#x2019; Mistrustfully the boy picks up a slice of bread and nibbles at it. His fingernails, he notices, are black with dirt. As the last daylight wanes, they settle down in their shelter, he on a bed of weeds, the boy in the crook of his arm. Soon the boy is asleep, his thumb in his mouth. In his own case sleep is slow in coming. He has no coat; in a while the cold begins to seep up into his body; he begins to shiver. It is not serious, it is only cold, it will not kill you, he says to himself. The night will pass, the sun will rise, the day will come. Only let there not be crawling insects. Crawling insects will be too much. He is asleep. In the early hours he wakes up, stiff, aching with cold. Anger wells up in him. Why this pointless misery? He crawls out of the shelter, gropes his way to the back door, and knocks, first discreetly, then more and more loudly. A window opens above; by moonlight he can faintly make out the girl&#x2019;s face. &#x2018;Yes?&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Is something wrong?&#x2019; &#x2018;Everything is wrong,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;It is cold out here. Will you please let us into the house.&#x2019; There is a long pause. Then: &#x2018;Wait,&#x2019; she says. He waits. Then: &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; says her voice. An object falls at his feet: a blanket, none too large, folded in four, made of some rough material, smelling of camphor. &#x2018;Why do you treat us like this?&#x2019; he calls out. &#x2018;Like dirt?&#x2019; The window thuds to. He crawls back into the shelter, wraps the blanket around himself and the sleeping child. He is woken by a clamour of birdsong. The boy, still sound asleep, lies turned away from him, his cap under his cheek. His own clothes are damp with dew. He dozes away again. When next he opens his eyes the girl is gazing down on him. &#x2018;Good morning,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;I have brought you some breakfast. I have to leave soon. When you are ready I will let you out.&#x2019; &#x2018;Let us out?&#x2019; &#x2018;Let you out through the house. Please be quick. Don&#x2019;t forget to bring the blanket and the towel.&#x2019; He wakes the child. &#x2018;Come,&#x2019; he says, &#x2018;time to get up. Time for breakfast.&#x2019; They pee side by side in a corner of the yard. Breakfast turns out to be more bread and water. The child disdains it; he himself is not hungry. He leaves the tray untouched on the step. &#x2018;We are ready to go,&#x2019; he calls out. The girl leads them through the house into the empty street. &#x2018;Goodbye,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;You can come back tonight if you need to.&#x2019; &#x2018;What about the room you promised at the Centre?&#x2019; &#x2018;If the key can&#x2019;t be found, or the room has been taken in the mean�time, you can sleep here again. Goodbye.&#x2019; &#x2018;Just a minute. Can you help us with some money?&#x2019; Thus far he has not had to beg, but he does not know where else to turn. &#x2018;I said I would help you, I didn&#x2019;t say I would provide you with money. For that you will have to go to the offices of the Asistencia Social. You can catch a bus in to the city. Be sure to take your pass�book along, and your proof of residence. Then you can draw your relocation allowance. Alternatively you can find a job and ask for an advance. I won&#x2019;t be at the Centre this morning, I have meetings, but if you go there and tell them you are looking for a job and want un vale, they will know what you mean. Un vale. Now I really must run.&#x2019; The track he and the boy follow across the empty parklands turns out to be the wrong one; by the time they reach the Centre the sun is already high in the sky. Behind the Trabajos counter is a woman of middle age, stern-faced, her hair drawn back over her ears and tied tightly behind. &#x2018;Good morning,&#x2019; he says. &#x2018;We checked in yesterday. We are new arrivals, and I am looking for work. I understand you can give me un vale.&#x2019; &#x2018;Vale de trabajo,&#x2019; says the woman. &#x2018;Show me your passbook.&#x2019; He gives her his passbook. She inspects it, returns it. &#x2018;I will write you a vale, but as for the line of work you do, that is up to you to decide on.&#x2019; &#x2018;Have you any suggestions for where I should begin? This is foreign territory to me.&#x2019; &#x2018;Try the docks,&#x2019; says the woman. &#x2018;They are usually on the lookout for workers. Catch the Number 29 bus. It leaves from outside the main gate every half-hour.&#x2019; &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have money for buses. I don&#x2019;t have money at all.&#x2019; &#x2018;The bus is free. All buses are free.&#x2019; &#x2018;And a place to stay? May I raise the question of a place to stay? The young lady who was on duty yesterday, Ana she is called, reserved a room for us, but we haven&#x2019;t been able to gain access.&#x2019; &#x2018;There are no rooms free.&#x2019; &#x2018;There was a room free yesterday, room C-55, but the key was mislaid. The key was in the care of se�ora Weiss.&#x2019; &#x2018;I know nothing about that. Come back this afternoon.&#x2019; &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t I speak to se�ora Weiss?&#x2019; &#x2018;There is a meeting of senior staff this morning. Se�ora Weiss is at the meeting. She will be back in the afternoon.&#x2019;</p><h2>Proof of Intent: A Charley Sloan Courtroom Thriller (Charley Sloan Courtroom Thrillers)</h2><p>Charley Sloan isn't your typical lawyer. But then again, this isn't your typical case. When famous author and hometown hero Miles Dane is arrested for murdering his wife, it seems like an open-and-shut case. With no credible alibi, a mountain of physical evidence, and a motive of millions, it seems the prosecution's case is airtight.<br><br>The police suspect that Dane had planned this crime many years ago--and made the mistake of writing it all down...in exact detail. Even Charley begins to question Dane's innocence. But Charley's own investigation gives him reason to believe that his client is being framed and that the real killer is using Dane's own bizarre imagination against him. But why isn't Dane speaking up? What secrets is he hiding?<br><br>As the trial begins, it's still unclear where Miles Dane's wild imaginings stop and reality begins. Or whether he is committing the ultimate sacrifice in order to atone for something he did long ago. Only in the crucible of the final, fevered moments of trial will Charley finally put the pieces together and reveal the stunning truth...<br></p><p>William Coughlin's series character Charley Sloan gets a second lease on life in this new thriller that carries the small-town Michigan lawyer into murder and mayhem; vintage heroes never die, even if their creators do, and Walter Sorrells, a talented writer whose mysteries plow much of the same ground, carries on Coughlin's series with a nifty setup--a bestselling crime writer fallen on hard times who's accused of murdering his wife in a plot taken from one of his own books. Miles Dane may get away with murder unless Charley can prove he's been set up by the man who may--or may not--be his long-lost son. This is a solid legal thriller that will delight the late Coughlin's fans who've wondered what happened to Charley and what's still happening in picturesque Pickeral Point. Long may the franchise wave! <i>--Jane Adams</i>William J. Coughlin, a former defense attorney and judge in Detroit for twenty years, was the author of sixteen novels.

She has a Ph.D. in English and works as a freelance writer and editor. She lives outside of Charlottesville, Virginia.One afternoon in 1796, Mary Lamb, aged 31, killed her mother with a carving knife at the dinner table. Like Kathy Watson in her recent <i>The Devil Kissed Her: The Story of Mary Lamb, </i>Hitchcock diagnoses manic-depression at the heart of Mary's matricidal act and her subsequent stays in Britain's early mental asylums. Hitchcock (<i>Coming About: A Family Passage at Sea</i>), however, is far more willing to speculate about the gaps in the record of Mary's life, not to mention her thoughts and feelings as she regained something like a normal existence after the murder, which was judged an act of madness. Despite eventual bestselling collaborations with her brother, essayist Charles Lamb, in <i>Tales from Shakespeare </i>and <i>Poetry for Children</i>, Mary left an erratic documentary trail, with only one significant personal essay, which Hitchcock sees as proto-feminist. Charles, her lifelong protector, remains the best source about his sister and their shared life. But his letters to such friends as Samuel Coleridge and Robert Southey show some reserve about the delicate subject of his sister's mental health. With such gaps, Hitchcock often resorts to reading into existing texts or inferring details of Mary's asylum experiences from typical practices of the time, which only partially resuscitates this tragic but elusive life. 32 illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fully updated with new material on the enigmatic Millar.</p><p>Cyclist Robert Millar came from one of Europe&#x2019;s most industrialised cities, Glasgow, to excel in the most unlikely terrain &#x2013; over the high mountain passes of the Pyrenees and the Alps.

The Bulgarian front resounds with the thunder of cavalry charges, the roar of artillery, and the clash of steel on steel during the world&#x2019;s last great horse-and-cannon conflict. Amid the treacherous atmosphere of a nineteenth-century Russian field army, former diplomat and detective extraordinaire Erast Fandorin finds his most confounding case.<br><br>It&#x2019;s difficulties are only compounded by the presence of Varya Suvorova, a deadly serious (and seriously beautiful) woman with revolutionary ideals who has disguised herself as a boy in order to find her respected comrade&#x2013; and fianc�&#x2013;Pyotr Yablokov, an army cryptographer. Even after Fandorin saves her life, Varya can hardly bear to thank such a &#x201c;lackey of the throne&#x201d; for his efforts.<br><br>But when Yablokov is accused of espionage and faces imprisonment and execution, Varya must turn to Fandorin to find the real culprit . . . a mission that forces her to reconsider his courage, deductive mind, and piercing gaze.<br><br>Filled with the same delicious detail, ingenious plotting, and subtle satire as <i>The Winter Queen </i>and <i>Murder on the Leviathan</i>, <b>The Turkish Gambit</b> confirms Boris Akunin&#x2019;s status as a master of the historical thriller&#x2013;and Erast Fandorin as a detective for the ages.</p><p>Russian author Boris Akunin clearly delights in literary experimentation. <i>The Winter Queen</i>, his first novel to win U.S. release, was a police procedural, introducing a young but brilliant detective named Erast Petrovich Fandorin, serving in 1876 Moscow. However, <i>Murder on the Leviathan</i> (actually the third entry in the Fandorin series, but published second in the States) was quite different--an homage to formulaic Golden Age whodunits, taking place on a luxurious steamship. Now comes <i>The Turkish Gambit</i>, which is more a combination of war novel and romance, rather than crime fiction, with the majority of its mysteries so transparent as to barely merit the label.<p> The action here takes place in 1877 and 1878, on the Balkan front of a military conflict pitting tsarist Russia against the Ottoman Empire. Into this realm of posturing commanders and the foreign journalists whose florid prose makes those officers look better (or worse) than they really are ride Fandorin, now with the diplomatic corps, and Varya Suvorova, a strong-willed 22-year-old telegraphist hoping to reunite on the battlefield with her "future fianc�," an army volunteer. But Varya's efforts are frustrated when her intended is accused of espionage. His release can only be won by identifying the real informant-cum-saboteur, in which task Varya is willing to cooperate with Fandorin, despite her dislike of the stuttering and apparently "cold, disagreeable" former policeman. Amid profuse digressions concerning Turkish politics, female suffrage, and the harem system ("without it many women would quite simply starve to death"), Varya--trailed by lustful correspondents--investigates a suspicious colonel in Bucharest, only to become party to a deadly duel. A pair of officers are subsequently murdered, a guilt-ridden soldier hangs himself, and a British plot against Russia is alleged.</p><p> Akunin (the pseudonym of Grigory Chkhartishvili) nimbly portrays the tumultuous atmosphere of 19th-century combat, complete with ear-splitting cannon blasts and hard-charging cossacks. His dialogue is frequently clever, and in Varya he has created a woman fully capable of steering yarns and stopping hearts. Yet <i>The Turkish Gambit</i> is so laden with expendable exchanges, trivial players, and hieings off to hither and yon, that the reader's interest may wane well short of this story's dramatic climax. <i>--J.

Whatever his other accomplishments, he is best remembered as an enigmatic seer, the man who could foretell events, though he could not specify when in the future they would occur. Modern readers tend to view Nostradamus either as a relic from a superstitious age or as an inspired visionary. In this book Georges Dum�zil, renowned scholar of myth and religion, takes Nostradamus very seriously indeed. Can one foresee the future, Dum�zil asks, and fail to understand it?</p><p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, commentators on Nostradamus found in the twentieth quatrain of Nostradamus's Century 9 a bundle of precise details that seemed to predict the arrest of Louis XVI as he fled the French Revolution. Other details in the quatrain remained unexplained. Why was the person described as "le moyne noir"? What did the second verse signify: "Deux parts, vaultorte, Herne, la pierre blanche"? What can scholarship contribute to the understanding of these puzzles?</p><p>Dum�zil explores three possibilities: a philological and historical study of the text to clarify its enigmas by a deeper investigation of Louis XVI's unsuccessful flight to Varennes; a logical analysis, determining how Nostradamus would have interpreted a view of the eighteenth century from his vantage in the sixteenth; and, finally, a metaphysical inquiry into the status and process of prediction. Written in dialogue form, The Riddle of Nostradamus is one of Dum�zil's most arresting works, challenging dogmas, even scholarly ones, and raising sharp questions about how much we want to know, and why. Shunning the usual forms of academic inquiry to probe the grey regions that stretch between knowledge and belief, the book not only studies, but exemplifies, the role of the riddle in discussing portentous events.</p><p>"This book by Georges Dum�zil is about Dum�zil -- about his scholarly methods and even about his life. It is a tour de force application of his methodology. As such, it amounts to a brilliant exercise in comparative method and reconstruction. It is easy to speak here of his methods; to speak of his life will be more difficult." -- from the Foreword, by Gregory Nagy</p></p><p><p>Georges Dum�zil was one the most provocative scholars of modern comparative religion.

In the early thirteenth century, they became the focus of systematic repression by both the monarchy and the Church, and were forced to wear the yellow cross, the original heretics&#x2019; symbol of shame. In successive waves of brutal persecution, thousands of Cathars were captured, summarily tried, and burned at the stake. Yet so ardent was the faith of their community that during the years 1290 to 1320 the Cathars rose up one last time.<br><br>Ren� Weis tells the full story of these thirty years with the aid of remarkably detailed documentation&#x2014;including previously untapped trial records, verbatim notes of interrogations, and minutes of the Inquisitors&#x2014;as well as his own intimate knowledge of the last Cathars&#x2019; hiding places, many of which survive to this day.

The family names of Montaillou in the last decade of the thirteenth century were Argelier, Arzelier, Authi? (not related to the Axian Perfects and passim Authi? [B]), Az?ma, Baille, Bar, Belot, Benet, Bonclergue, Capelle, Caravessas, Castanier, Clergue, Clergue (B), Faure, Ferri?, Fort, Fournier, Guilabert, Julia, Lizier, Mamol (?), Martre, Marty, Maurs, Maury, Moyshen, P?lissier, Pourcel, Rives, Rous (alias "Colel"), Savenac, Tavernier (?), Teisseyre, Trilhe (or Trialh?), and Vital.<br><br>For the purpose of counting the people of Montaillou over a period of eighteen years, the years from c. 1291, the arrival of B?atrice, to 1308, the year the village was raided, seem an appropriate time-span since they coincide with the main Cathar episode. In this period the majority of the villagers whom we will encounter in these pages were born, or grew from their teens and twenties into early middle age. My focus therefore will be mostly the 1280s to mid-1290s generation.<br><br>Some 160 of the men, women and children of Montaillou can be identified by name, and there were probably some 250 people living in the village, if the average household is conservatively estimated at five bodies, to include two parents and at least three children per family. Various illegitimate children as well as grandparents and servants were also looked after in nuclear families. In addition there may have been a handful of families residing in the village whose presence is not specifically recorded in the Registers. And the figure of 250 does not include the occupants of the castle, the ch?telaine, her husband, their children and their staff.<br><br>In this deeply rural culture men and women needed to be able to depend mutually on one another for survival, hence family links were a bastion of strength. It was the blood ties between clans and families that ultimately provided the Authi?s, and other local Perfects such as Prades Tavernier, Pons Sicre and Arnaud Marty, with a century-old safety net that could never quite be shredded by the Inquisition. Even the Bishop of Pamiers would be aided in his task by family connections. For that reason it is essential to map out the major families of Montaillou before proceeding any further; families from other villages and towns, notably Prades, Ax, Luzenac, Larnat, Tarascon and Junac, and from the Toulousain also played a leading role in the dissemination of Catharism, and they will be met in due course.<br><br>Although it is not possible to locate with certainty the whereabouts in the village of all the participants, the homes of the most important among them can be identified on the grid with some confidence (Map 3). My conclusions are generated from a mosaic of mutually corroborative, and mostly incidental, remarks by various witnesses. These are crucially complemented by a striking passage in Pierre Maury's testimony, which appears to offer a semi-structured survey of the village's households (FR, f.257v; see below, page 34). It is a major source for confirming and, in some cases, determining the location in Montaillou of several among the lesser houses in the village.<br><br>In the 1290s and in the early years of the fourteenth century Montaillou was dominated by four powerful and variously affluent clans whose houses clustered in the vicinity of the square of Montaillou. They were called Belot, Benet, Rives and Clergue.<br><b><br>The Cathar trio and the Clergues</b><br><br>The houses of the Belots, Benets and Rives were built into the slope of the hill on the north-western side of the main artery so that their fronts faced south or south-east. These properties occupied the space between the junction of capanal den belot and the village square itself, and they were easily overlooked from the plateau. In clement weather their back-roofs provided a favourite place for the social and physical ritual of mutual delousing. All three were substantial dwellings with barns, vegetable gardens and dry-walled courtyards with gates or portals which verged on the village's track. Even the poorer houses of Montaillou usually had vegetable and herb gardens at the front, as did some of the houses in the square. Some properties, like the P?lissiers', were separated from the road by hedges.<br><br>The Belots: This large house was low-roofed (bassum) at the back, because of the slope and the convex arching of the "inner" path to Prades which ran down past it into<i> capanal den belot </i>(FR, f.60v). In front of its substantial porch extended the Belots' south-east-facing courtyard, which overlooked the Clergues. It was an obvious place for gossiping matriarchs to take the sun. Slightly apart from the porch was a spot called "las penas," which may have been reserved for servants, and from here the servants would eavesdrop on their mistress's conversations. The Belots were the second-wealthiest clan in the village. They were rich enough to recruit and employ servants, and the boundaries between servant and master were repeatedly transgressed in this household, which was a hive of sexual activity.<br><br>There were two parents, four sons and two (or perhaps three) daughters.The sons were called Raymond, Bernard, Guillaume and Arnaud, and the daughters were Raymonde and Alazais, and perhaps Arnaude. The Belot patriarch's name is not known, but he may have been dead by the end of the 1290s because by then the Belots' house was commonly called "Raymond Belot's house," which probably indicates that Raymond was the eldest son and the new head of the family; unless, of course, the father was also called Raymond, in which case the name of the house simply continued. That the Belot brothers Raymond and Bernard shared the house as owners was noted by the new ch?telaine when she lived in the village during this period. The younger Belot brothers were ruffians, and while Bernard Belot sexually assaulted the wife of another Montalionian, his brother Arnaud fathered an illegitimate child called ?tienne when he was still, it seems, in his teens. The Belot mother was called Guillemette, and she would have been in her forties or early fifties in the 1290s. She was on intimate terms with her neighbour and contemporary Mengarde Clergue, the matriarch of the richest and most powerful family in Montaillou. In their devotion to the Cathar cause the Belots did not lag far behind the illustriously connected Benets.<br><br>The Benets: The Benets' house stood a few yards north-east and down the hill from the Belots'. It was their home which provided the initial channel for the Cathar reawakening in Montaillou, because Guillaume Benet of Montaillou was the uncle of the Perfect Guillaume Authi?'s wife.<br><br>Guillaume and Guillemette Benet had three sons and four daughters. When Montane Benet was born c. 1301-2 her sisters Esclarmonde and Guillemette were "little girls," and her brother Bernard was still only a child in 1308. The relative youth of the Benet children suggests that Guillemette, the mother of the household, was younger than either of the neighbouring matriarchs Guillemette Belot and Mengarde Clergue, who were direct contemporaries. Guillemette Benet may not have been much older than B?atrice de Planisolles. She repeatedly expressed her horror of the pain inflicted by fire, and later had to endure the agony of seeing her brother-in-law being burnt at the stake.<br><br>Whereas all the major houses owned livestock and farmed, there was also a need for skilled craftsmen. Just as there were weavers in the village, so the Benets may have been builders, that is masons or roofers, because they owned tools. It is significant that the rich Belots' extension was built for them rather than by them, which suggests that a labour market operated in Montaillou. The wood for roofing, barns and enclosures came from the plentiful thick forests to the south-east of the village. As the wheel does not seem to have existed in the Pays d'Aillou in the thirteenth century, tree trunks needed either to be dragged into the village by oxen, or transported on the back of mules.<br><br>The Rives: The house of Bernard and Alazais Rives was the next one down from the Benets', and was in fact partly terraced with it. Theirs was a large and wealthy corner-house at the intersection of the main artery of Montaillou and the south-eastern side of the village square, and it could be entered either from the square or from the road. Its front boasted a porch where picked vegetables and fruit were kept. It had interior stables for beasts whose waste was carried outside through the main entrance of the house and deposited on a dunghill in the courtyard on the side of the square. The Rives also owned a barn which was an extension of the house while having a separate outside entrance. In this place, which had a skylight, grass and bales of hay and straw were stored.<br><br>We have already noted that the house contained a much-used bread-oven, which was in a roomy space serving as both hearth and dining-room. The Occitan term for this nerve centre of a thirteenth-century Sabartesian house was foghana. To translate it as "kitchen," as Pales-Gobilliard does, fails to convey its importance as the preferred area for eating and sitting as well as for cooking, drying meat and baking, and for laying out the dead. It was in the foghana that life was played out during the winter, when the gossips gathered around the fire, and the bedrooms as well as the stables were usually off it. For these reasons I propose to retain the Occitan phrase to denote this inclusive core area where so many key events took place.<br><br>The Rives owed their economic importance to their local landholding. They were prosperous farmers, who also kept animals for food and work; and they were active weavers. Next to the main Rives property, in the square of Montaillou itself, stood a junior Rives house which probably belonged to Bernard's brother Raymo...</p><h2>Stately Pursuits</h2><p><b>[This is the Audiobook CASSETTE Library Edition in vinyl case.]</b><br><br> <i>''You're not doing very much at the moment, darling.

Judd writes regularly for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in London.CHAPTER ONE<br>LONDON, MID-1970s<br><br>It was a warm summer when Charles Thoroughgood left the army and joined the Secret Service but politically the world was deep in the Cold War. He moved to London and rented a basement flat in Kensington with a view of sodden detritus in the well of the building and the housekeeper's kitchen. He suspected that, from behind her dirty net curtains, she spent days and nights in unprofitable surveillance of his own uncurtained window. "Slack Alice," Roger Donnington, his colleague and flatmate, had dubbed her. "Face that would stop a coal barge."<br><br>One autumn Monday, he got up after a restless night to a humid, muggy London. The flat's tiny bathroom had no window and the electricity was off. Shaving by candlelight was a slow operation because he had to keep moving the candle as he traversed each cheek, and it was difficult to get any light at all beneath the chin without risk of singeing. He had long owned an electric razor, a present from his mother, but it had never left its box. The idea of using it had always felt like a concession to something, perhaps a luxurious and corrupting modernity. It was irrelevant now, anyway, because he had used the battery for his radio. Calling an electrician to restore mains power had, so far, proved too great a concession for either him or Roger.<br><br>The milk and butter in the powerless fridge smelt rancid. Someone would have to throw them away, sometime. He made toast in the gas stove, covered it with Marmite and drank black tea. He tidied the bedclothes on his double mattress on the floor, put on his light suit and flicked a tie free of the clothes crammed on the hook on his bedroom door. Before leaving he knocked on Roger's door. Roger had his own mattress in the sitting room, with the television at its foot. Charles had got in late the night before, so had no idea whether Roger was alone or accompanied. There was no answer. He knocked again, louder. "Okay?" he called.<br><br>Roger's groan became a cough. "Okay."<br><br>It was not to be a normal day at the office, though few were at that time. He was glad of that: secret service seemed so far to provide the advantages of bureaucratic employment--security, purpose, companionship and, though he might not yet have admitted it to himself, the pleasing consciousness of service--without the monotony he assumed to go with office life. He wouldn't need his bike that day, so left it propped up against the bedroom wall.<br><br>The best features of the flat were the front door of the building and the curving staircase, both of a size and grandeur to give an impression of spaciousness and opulence within. It had been cheaply converted into flats during the 1950s and 1960s and already the additions seemed older and more worn than the house. The plaster was cracked, paintwork faded, doors warped and skirting boards had parted company with their walls. The door of Charles's flat was tucked beneath the bottom turn of the staircase, so that stepping from it into the entrance hall was literally to enter a bigger and brighter world.<br><br>Out on Queensgate, he turned left towards Hyde Park after a deliberate glance across the wide street to check that his car was undamaged. The rush-hour traffic was heavier than usual, perhaps in anticipation of further wildcat strikes on the Underground, and the delay in crossing the Cromwell Road gave him the pretext to look about as if seeking a quicker way. He did the same at Kensington Gore, then walked behind the Albert Memorial and into the park. He walked unhurriedly, trying to establish a regular but not purposeless pace.<br><br>He looked back around again before he crossed the Serpentine Road and took one of the footpaths to Marble Arch and Speakers Corner. Anyone following would have to keep well back, or ahead or to the side, but then close quickly before Charles entered the Marble Arch subway. Presumably they would have car as well as foot surveillance, and radio. A car team might become a foot team when they needed to close, but to do that the cars would have to loiter in the busy Park Lane or Bayswater Road, which was never easy.<br><br>Once in the subway and reasonably sure he was out of sight, he broke the rules by looking behind without an obvious reason. None of the figures in the park was hurrying. No puffy, sweaty man or woman suddenly appeared at the top of the steps. Perhaps they were waiting in Queensgate for Roger, if they were there at all. They might have a long wait.<br><br>In Oxford Street he made for C&amp;A, where he bought two pairs of black socks. It was cooler in the store and he loitered a while among the suits, before taking a back street to Marylebone Station, walking slowly with his jacket over his arm. At the station he bought a day return to Beaconsfield. The newsagent had sold out of The Times because the printers had gone on strike during the night, leaving only the early editions available. There would be time to find one later. He settled for the previous week's Economist.<br><br>He knew the forty-minute journey. Whether or not they were following by car, they would have to put at least one watcher on the train with him. If there were any "they." He read until the approaching Chilterns countryside gave reason for glancing about the carriage. It was tempting to get off at one of the small stations before Beaconsfield to see who got off with him, but that was cinema stuff. The trick in evading surveillance, they were told, was not only to get away but to give the impression you weren't looking for surveillance because you were innocent of anything that would merit it. At Seer Green, the last halt before Beaconsfield, he glimpsed a Ford Escort in the car park with Russian diplomatic number plates. He saw it too late to get the number but was sure enough of its origin. They were supposed to report all such sightings.<br><br>At Beaconsfield a grizzled, grey-haired man wearing jeans and incongruously polished brown shoes got off with him. Charles walked unhurriedly up the station approach, pausing to look in a shop window at the top. The man crossed the road and became engrossed in an estate agent's window. Charles continued his walk, turning left towards Old Beaconsfield, with its stockbroker Tudor avenues, neo-Georgian mini-mansions and moguls' houses of the twenties and thirties, with large unseen gardens and new Jaguars and Rovers in swept gravel drives. The low cloud had thinned enough to permit weak sunshine.<br><br>He strode purposefully into Hughes's, the Mercedes dealership. The forecourt was lined with polished secondhand saloons described as "nearly new," with their distinctive vertical headlights and squared-off, no-nonsense styling. Beige seemed the most popular colour, followed by red. To one side was a trio of elegant sports models with their dished roofs and thick, rounded leather seats. Immediately outside the showroom was a luxurious new S class, gleaming silver and easily the biggest car there. Charles paused by it before entering the show-room and wandering with what he hoped was critical detachment among the new cars within.<br><br>A salesman sat smoking at a desk with a telephone, a notepad, a Mercedes brochure and a copy of Glass's Guide, the trade price list. He had rubbery features and crinkly dark hair. Charles watched through the window as Brown Shoes crossed the forecourt to the older saloons. His back was to the showroom but he could probably see it in the car windscreens. The salesman took two long pulls on his cigarette before stubbing it out and slipping Glass's Guide into his desk drawer. He rose and came over to Charles, his features now composed into a rubbery smile. "Can I help, sir?"<br><br>"I'm thinking of buying a car."<br><br>"Just what we like to hear, sir. Mercedes, I take it?"<br><br>"Could be."<br><br>"Anything you'll be wanting to trade in?"<br><br>"No, I'll pay cash."<br><br>He made himself the ideal customer, accepting a cigarette while they discussed models and prices over coffee. The salesman was happy to talk residual values but became vague when asked pointed questions about trade prices. Brown Shoes studied the sports cars on the forecourt. They walked round the new cars in the showroom, then outside to the one and two year olds nearby. Brown Shoes crossed the forecourt to the older saloons, still with his back to them. Charles gave the impression that cost was less important to him than style and comfort, that he might be inclined to wait for the new mid-range model, that he would probably look in on Jaguar, BMW and Rover dealerships, with a possible nod in the direction of Volvo. There was the family to think of, and Volvo seemed to make a great thing about safety, which no one else did. Unless, of course, he allowed himself to be wooed by the new S class. That would presumably be even more solid and long-lasting than a Volvo and he particularly liked it in silver.<br><br>"You look every inch a Mercedes man, if I may say so, sir," the salesman said as they shook hands and Charles pocketed his card. "Love to see you in one."<br><br>Clutching his brochures, Charles carried on towards Old Beaconsfield. He had provided anyone watching with a reason for his visit and himself evidence, in the event of questioning, as to what he had been doing. He had ensured that the man in the dealership would remember him. He had also created time and space to spot surveillance.<br><br>It was not far but few walked the busy road. They might have a team of cars on him but, Brown Shoes having remained on the forecourt, he was sure he was the only walker. In an Old Beaconsfield tea shop he lingered over more coffee and ate shortbread, reading his magazine and listening to the conversation of two mothers with children at the same school. They were discussing a third whose marriage had broken up, whose mother was dying and whose child was ill.<br><br>"I didn't like to ask too much," said one. "She looked so awful, as if she might burst into tears at any moment. White as a sheet.&amp;q...</p><h2>Canon and Creativity: Modern Writing and the Authority of Scripture (The Franz Rosenzweig Lecture Series)</h2><p>Approaching the debates about literary canon from an entirely new angle, a foremost literary critic explores how a range of iconoclastic twentieth-century authors (in particular Kafka, Bialik, and Joyce) have put to use the paramount canonical text--the Hebrew Bible. Robert Alter argues against the notion that the canon is a vehicle of ideological enforcement and shows instead that canons are by nature surprisingly elastic and enabling for later writers</p><p>The term <i>canon,</i> which originally referred only to the collection of sacred scriptures endorsed by ecclesiastical authority, has in recent decades been adapted to a secular context, as a name for the collection of great books most venerated by mainstream cultural authorities. The term's elasticity is the subject of <i>Canon and Creativity: Modern Writing and the Authority of Scripture</i> by literary critic Robert Alter (author of <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i> and translator of <i>Genesis</i> and <i>The David Story</i>). Alter begins with a brief essay on the history of the canon of the Hebrew Bible; his subsequent readings of Kafka, Joyce, and the Russian poet Bialik (who wrote in Hebrew) concentrate on the ways in which each writer's creative strengths were enabled by their reference to the biblical canon. Together, the four essays present a compact, understated argument against the idea that canon is merely "a vehicle for theological truths" and praising "the perennial liveliness of the old canonical texts as a resource for imagination and moral reflection." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Anyone interested in literature of any kind could enjoy and profit from this fascinating and elegant book.&#34;-John HollanderIn this illuminating book, one of our foremost literary critics views the much-debated question of the literary canon from an entirely new angle. Robert Alter explores the ways in which a range of iconoclastic twentieth-century authors have put to use the stories, language, and imagery of the paramount canonical text-the Hebrew Bible. Alter makes a compelling case against the prevalent, pejorative notion of the canon as a vehicle of ideological enforcement. He shows instead that canons by nature are surprisingly elastic, providing later writers with imaginative resources even when those same writers rebel against what they conceive as the constraints of the canon. Focusing special attention on Franz Kafka&#39;s Amerika, Haim Nahman Bialik&#39;s The Dead of the Desert, and James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, Alter brings to bear an unusual perspective, putting into a single frame of discussion three writers from widely different linguistic traditions (German, Hebrew, English) and from disparate cultural settings (Prague, Odessa, Dublin). Alter&#39;s close readings of these major modern writers reveal how reference to canonical antecedents can be both surprisingly various and enabling. Examining the diverse modes in which Biblical material becomes interwoven with the fabric of a new work, he also offers new insights into the nature and range of modernism. Critically appreciative rather than polemic in tone, Alter conveys in this thoughtful book a renewed sense of the vitality of literary modernism.</p><h2>Rolling Thunder (A Thunder and Lightning Novel)</h2><p>Lieutenant Patricia Kelly Elizabeth Strickland?otherwise known as Podkayne?has joined the Music, Arts, and Drama Division of the Martian Navy, passing the audition with a little help from some higher-ups. And now she?s going to Europa, one of Jupiter?s many moons, to be an entertainer.

He has won both the Nebula and Hugo awards for his work.Nebula and Hugo&#x2013;winner Varley continues the space opera saga of the Garcia-Strickland clan (last encountered in 2006's <i>Red Lightning</i>) in this enjoyable if simplistic tale. Patricia Kelly Elizabeth Podkayne Strickland-Garcia-Redmond, daughter of an earlier series hero, Ray Garcia-Strickland, is glad for any excuse to escape her job as the Martian consul in California, but the news calling her home is dire: her great grandmother is ill and about to go into suspended animation. After a family reunion, Podkayne heads to Europa, where a disaster forces her own suspension. The solar system she awakens to 10 years later is radically different. Podkayne learns of looming trials threatening the survival of mankind and tackles them with undiminished determination. Varley has deliberately made Podkayne an uncomplicated figure who lets major events and traumas roll right off her, rendering her a less than satisfying protagonist despite her heroics. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr Cho points out, 'It is because I believe in revival and in renewal that I have written this book. It has been historically true that prayer has been the key to every revival in the history of Christianity.' <p>Out of his personal experience as a pastor, Dr Cho answers such general questions as why to pray, how to pray, when to pray. He also deals with such specific questions as: What is the link between prayer and fasting? Why does fasting increase the effectiveness of prayer? What does prayer accomplish? What part does the Holy Spirit play in prayer? What are the different kinds of prayer? </p><p>&#x2018;No man can schedule a revival,&#x2019; Dr Cho has said, &#x2018;for God alone is the giver of life.

Ahead of him, he saw Gorst, his second, the giant, shirtless fighter ripping through the vines and branches as if they had no substance at all. While most of the other mercenaries, natives of cooler, highland regions in the Western Kingdoms, suffered badly from the heat, bronzed Gorst ever took all in stride. The scraggy mop of hair, dark black compared with Kentril's own light brown, made the giant look like a fleeing lion as he disappeared toward the river.<br><br>Following his friend's trail, Captain Dumon made better time. The screaming continued, bringing back graphic memories of the other three men the party had lost since entering the vast jungle that covered most of this land. The second had died a most horrible death, snared in the web of a horde of monstrous spiders, his body so injected with poison that it had become bloated and distorted. Kentril had ordered torches used against the web and its hungry denizens, carefully burning out the creatures. It had not saved his man, but it had avenged the death somewhat.<br><br>The third hapless fighter had never been found. He had simply vanished during an arduous trek through an area filled with soft soil that pulled one's boots down with each step. Having nearly sunken to his knees at one point, the weary captain suspected he knew the fate of the lost soldier. The mud could be quick and efficient in its work.<br><br>And as he considered the death of the very first mercenary lost to Kehjistan's fearsome jungles, Kentril stepped out into a scene almost identical to that disaster.<br><br>A huge, serpentine form rose well above the riverbank, long reptilian orbs narrowed at the small figures below who sought in vain to pry free the struggling form in its tremendous maw. Even with its jaws clamped tight on the frantic mercenary whose screams had alerted Kentril and the others, it somehow managed to hiss furiously at the humans. A lance stuck out of its side, but the strike had evidently been a shallow one, for the behemoth appeared in no way even annoyed by it.<br><br>Someone loosed an arrow toward the head, likely aiming for the terrible eyes, but the shaft flew high, bouncing off the scaly hide. The tentacle beast -- the name their esteemed employer, Quov Tsin, had used for such horrors -- swung its prey around and around, giving Kentril at last a glimpse of whom it had seized.<br><br>Hargo. Of course, it would be Hargo. The bearded idiot had been much a disappointment on this journey, having shirked many of his duties since their arrival on this side of the Twin Seas. Still, even Hargo deserved no such fate as this, whatever his shortcomings.<br><br>"Get rope ready!" Kentril shouted at his men. The creatures had twin curved horns toward the backs of their heads, the one place on their snakelike bodies that the mercenaries might be able to use to their advantage. "Keep him from returning to deep water!"<br><br>As the others followed his instructions, Captain Dumon counted them. Sixteen, including himself and the unfortunate Hargo. That accounted for everyone -- except Quov Tsin.<br><br>Where was the damned Vizjerei this time? He had a very annoying habit of wandering ahead of the band he had hired, leaving the mercenaries to guess half the time what he wanted of them. Kentril regretted ever taking this offer, but the talk of treasure had been so insistent, so beguiling...<br><br>He shook such thoughts from his head. Hargo still had a slim chance for life. The tentacle beast could have easily bitten him in two, but they just as often preferred to drag their prey under and let the water do their work for them. Made their meals soft and manageable, too, so the cursed sorcerer had said with scholarly indifference.<br><br>The men had the ropes ready. Kentril ordered them in place. Others still harassed the gargantuan serpent, making it forget that it could have long finished this encounter just by backing away. If the mercenaries could rely on its simple animal mind a little longer -- <br><br>Gorst had a line set to toss. He did not wait for Kentril to give the order, already understanding what the captain wanted. The giant threw the loop with unerring accuracy, snagging the rope on the right horn.<br><br>"Oskal! Try to throw Hargo a line! Benjin! Get that rope on the other horn! You two -- give Gorst a hand with that now!"<br><br>Stout Oskal tossed his rope toward the weakening, blood-soaked figure in the behemoth's maw. Hargo tried in vain to grab it, but it fell short. The tentacle beast hissed again and tried to retreat, only to have the line held by Gorst and the other two men keep it from getting very far.<br><br>"Benjin! The other horn, damn you!"<br><br>"Tell 'im to quit wigglin', and I will, captain!"<br><br>Oskal threw the rope again, and this time Hargo managed to grab it. With what strength he had, he looped it around him.<br><br>The entire tableau reminded Kentril of some macabre game. Again he cursed himself for accepting this contract, and he cursed Quov Tsin for having offered it in the first place.<br><br>Where <i>was</i> the foul sorcerer? Why had he not come running with the rest? Could he be dead?<br><br>The captain doubted his luck could be that good. Whatever the Vizjerei's present circumstances, they would have no effect on the desperate situation here. Everything rested on Kentril's already burdened shoulders.<br><br>A few of the fighters continued to try to wound the serpentine monster in any way they could. Unfortunately, the tough hide of the tentacle beast prevented those with lances and swords from doing any harm, and the two archers still at work had to watch out for fear of slaying the very man they hoped to save.<br><br>A rope caught the left horn. Captain Dumon fought back the swell of hope he felt; it had been one thing to catch the monster, but now they had to bring it in.<br><br>"Everyone who can, grab onto the lines! Bring that thing onto shore! It'll be more clumsy, more vulnerable on land!"<br><br>He joined with the others, pulling on the line Benjin had tossed. The tentacle beast hissed loudly, and although it clearly understood at some level the danger it faced, it still did not release its captive. Kentril could generally admire such tenacity in any living creature, but not when the life of one of his men was also at stake.<br><br>"Pull!" the captain shouted, sweat from the effort making his brown shirt cling to his body. His leather boots -- his fine leather boots that he had bought with the pay from his last contract -- sank into the muddy ground near the river. Despite four men on each rope, it took all they could give just to inch the aquatic horror onto the shore.<br><br>Yet inch it they did, and as the bulk of the beast came onto land, the mercenaries' efforts redoubled. A little more, and surely they could then free their comrade.<br><br>With the target much closer, one of the archers took aim.<br><br>"Hold your -- " was all Kentril got out before the shaft buried itself in the left eye.<br><br>The serpentine monster reared back in agony. It opened its mouth, but not enough to enable the gravely-injured Hargo to fall free, even with two men pulling from the ground. Despite having no appreciable limbs, the tentacle beast writhed back and forth so much that it began dragging all of its adversaries toward the dark waters.<br><br>One of the men behind Gorst slipped, sending another there also falling. The imbalance threw the rest of the mercenaries off. Benjin lost his grip, nearly stumbling into his captain in the process.<br><br>One orb a mass of ichor, the tentacle beast pulled back into the river.<br><br>"Hold him! Hold him!" Kentril shouted uselessly. Between the two ropes snaring the horns remained only five men. Gorst, his huge form a mass of taut muscle, made up for the fact that he had only one other mercenary with him, but in the end even his prodigious strength proved ineffective.<br><br>The back half of the gigantic reptile vanished under the water.<br><br>They had lost the battle; the captain knew that. In no way could they regain enough momentum to turn the tide.<br><br>And Hargo, somehow madly clinging onto life and consciousness, obviously knew that as well as Kentril Dumon did. His face a bloody mess, he shouted out hoarse pleas to all.<br><br>Kentril would not let this man go the same way the first one had. "Benjin! Grab the line again!"<br><br>"It's too late, captain! There's nothin' -- "<br><br>"Grab hold of it, I said!"<br><br>The moment the other fighter had obeyed, Kentril ran over to the nearest archer. The bowman stood transfixed, watching the unfolding fate of his unfortunate companion with a slack jaw and skin as pale as bone.<br><br>"Your bow! Give it to me!"<br><br>"Captain?"<br><br>"The bow, damn you!" Kentril ripped it out of the uncomprehending archer's hands. Captain Dumon had trained long and hard with the bow himself, and among his motley crew he could still count himself as the second or third best shot.<br><br>For what he intended now, Kentril prayed he would have the eye of the best.<br><br>Without hesitation, the wiry commander raised the bow, sighting his target as he did. Hargo stared back at him, and the pleas suddenly faltered. A look in the dying man's eyes begged the captain to fire quickly.<br><br>Kentril did.<br><br>The wooden bolt caught Hargo in the upper chest, burying itself deep.<br><br>Hargo slumped in the beast's jaws, dead instantly.<br><br>The act caught the other mercenaries completely by surprise. Gorst lost his grip. The others belatedly released theirs, not wanting to be pulled in by accident.<br><br>In sullen silence, the survivors watched as the wounded monster sank swiftly into the river, still hissing its rage and pain even as its head vanished below the surface. Hargo's arms briefly floated above the innocent-looking water -- then suddenly, they, too, disappeared below.<br><br>Letting the bow drop, Kentril turned and started away from the area.<br><br>The other fighters nervously gathered their things and followed, keeping much closer to one another. They had grown complacent after the third death, and now one of them had paid for that. Kentril blamed himself most of all, for, as company captain, he should have kept a better watch on his men. Only once before had he ever been forced to resort to slaying one of his own in order to alleviate suffering, and that had been on a good, solid battlefield, not in some insufferable madhouse of a jungle. That first man had been lying on the ground with a belly wound so massive that Captain Dumon had been amazed any life lingered. It had been a simple thing then to put the mortally wounded soldier to rest.<br><br>This...this had felt barbaric.<br><br>"Kentril," came Gorst's quiet voice. For someone so massive, the tanned giant could speak very softly when he chose. "Kentril. Hargo -- "<br><br>"Quiet, Gorst."<br><br>"Kentril -- "<br><br>"Enough." Of all those under his command through the past ten years, only Gorst ever called him by his first name. Captain Dumon had never offered that choice; the simplistic titan had just decided to do so. Perhaps that had been why they had become the best of friends, the only true friends among all those who had fought under Kentril for money.<br><br>Now only fifteen men remained. Fewer with whom to divide the supposed treasure the Vizjerei had offered, but fewer also to defend the party in case of trouble. Kentril would have dearly loved to have brought more, but he had been able to find no more takers of the offer. The seventeen hardened fighters accompanying him and Gorst had been all who would accept this arduous journey. The coins Quov Tsin had given him had barely paid them enough as it was.<br><br>And speaking of Tsin -- <i>where</i> was he?<br><br>"Tsin, damn you!" the scarred captain shouted to the jungle. "Unless you've been eaten, I want you to show yourself right now!"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>Peering through the dense jungle, Kentril searched for the diminutive spellcaster, but nowhere did he see Quov Tsin's bald head.<br><br>"Tsin! Show yourself, or I'll have the men start dumping your precious equipment into the river! Then you can go and talk to the beasts if you want to do any more of your incessant calculations!" Since the beginning of this trek, the Vizjerei had demanded pause after pause in order to set up instruments, draw patterns, and cast minor spells -- all supposedly to guide them to their destination. Tsin seemed to know where he headed, but up until now none of the others, not even Kentril, could have said the same.<br><br>A high-pitched, rather nasal voice called from the distance. Neither he nor Gorst could make out the words, but both readily recognized their employer's condescending tones.<br><br>"That way," the giant said, pointing ahead and slightly to the right of the party.<br><br>Knowing that the sorcerer had not only survived but had utterly ignored Hargo's fate ignited a fire within Kentril. Even as he proceeded, his hand slipped to the hilt of his sword. Just because the Vizjerei had purchased their services did not mean in any way that he could be forgiven for not lending his dubious talent with magic to the desperate hope of rescuing the ill-fated mercenary.<br><br>Yes, Kentril would have more than words with Quov Tsin...<br><br>"Where are you?" he called out.<br><br>"Here, of course!" snapped Tsin from somewhere behind the thick foliage. "Do hurry now! We've wasted so much valuable time!"<br><br><i>Wasted it?</i> Captain Dumon's fury grew. <i>Wasted it?</i> As a hired fighter and treasure hunter, he knew that his livelihood meant risking death every day, but Kentril had always prided himself on knowing the value of life nonetheless. It had always been those with the gold, those who offered riches, who least appreciated the cost the mercenary captain and his men suffered.<br><br>He drew the sword slowly from the scabbard. With each passing day, this trek had begun to seem more and more like a wild chase. Kentril had had enough. It was time to break the contract.<br><br>"That's not good," Gorst murmured. "You should put it back, Kentril."<br><br>"Just mind your place." No one, not even Gorst, would deter him.<br><br>"Kentril -- "<br><br>At that moment, the object of the slim captain's ire burst through the jungle foliage. To Kentril, who stood just over six feet in height, Gorst had always seemed an astonishing sight, but as tall as the giant appeared in comparison with his commander, so, too, did Dumon loom over the Vizjerei.<br><br>Legend had always made the race of sorcerers seem more than men, tall, hooded figures clad in rune-covered, red-orange cloaks called <i>Turinnash,</i> or "spirit mantles." The small silver runes covering much of the voluminous garment supposedly protected the mage from lesser magical threats and even, to a limited degree, some demonic powers. The Vizjerei wore the Turinnash proudly, almost like a badge of office, a mark of superiority. However, although Quov Tsin, too, had such a cloak, on his barely five-foot frame it did little to enhance any image of mystical power. The slight, wrinkled figure with the long gray beard reminded Kentril of nothing more than his elderly grandfather --...</p><h2>Four Classic American Novels: The Scarlet Letter; Huckleberry Finn; The Red Badge of Courage; Billy Budd</h2><p>Sweeping readers from the New England colonies to the banks of the Mississipppi, to the battle fields of the Civil War to the storm tossed waters of the Atlantic, this extraordinary collection is ideal-and most economical-for classrooms, libraries, and homes.</p><p><strong>Mark Twain</strong> was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri, in 1835, and died at Redding, Connecticut in 1910.

(Chuck Olson, executive pastor, Lake Avenue Church, Pasadena, California)<br><br>"As thousands of boomers are reaching the third phase of life each year, this book is timely. <em>The Third Third of Life</em> is a guide to living life to its fullest. It helps individuals and small groups question and examine what has been learned and experienced in the first phases of life. Those insights can then be intentionally applied to the third phase of life. This can be the time of greatest influence, investment in the lives of others, creativity, learning and enjoyment. This book will encourage and inspire the reader to truly engage the third phase of life." (Mary Andringa, president and CEO, Vermeer Corporation)<br><br>"As a third-thirder who is having the time of his life, I rejoice in the publication of Walter Wright's latest book, not only because his personal mentoring has had a transformative influence in my life but because <em>The Third Third of Life</em> addresses a critical issue in the twenty-first century. Is there life after work? Should we work until we die? Or play until we die? Or both? Wright offers more than helpful advice or a quick-fix formula. Based on research, personal interviews and his own spiritual journey, he has crafted a holistic and comprehensive guide for people facing future retirement, or retirement from retirement. This book is too good to miss!" (R. Paul Stevens, professor emeritus, Regent College, Vancouver, BC, and author of Doing God's Business and Work Matters)<br><br>"A few years ago Walter Wright visited me with a question: "How should I think about leadership transition, retirement and the third third of life?" . . . . With this guide, Walt invites you to enter our conversation, to check out your own experience, to design a third third that releases your potential, continues your opportunity to learn, to grow and contribute to the health of the world. I hope you find the questions provocative and the group process rewarding." (From the foreword by Max O.

It is famous for Revolutionary and Civil War battles as well as its early Native American settlements and the activity of American pioneers. Photographer Niemeyer, a native of Germany who has published three other photography books about America (Chesapeake Country, Abbeville, 1990), captures the landscapes, shows us the architecture and historic sites, and introduces us to Shenandoah's residents in nearly 200 color photos. Author Davis, who was reared in the area and wrote more than 20 books of history and fiction before her death in 1993, shares an abridgment of her 1945 book about Shenandoah. Her love of the land, its myths, and history pervades the informative text.

He travels the country performing the show at colleges and universities, and writes articles about social justice, gender, and sexuality when he&#x2019;s not on the road. His work has appeared in the New York Times, The Atlantic, and your Facebook news feed. Sam&#x2019;s obsession with understanding gender comes from his own experiences with gender and sexuality. He&#x2019;s constantly incorrectly assumed to be gay, which has everything to do with his gender and little-to-nothing to do with his sexuality. Gender is one of those things everyone thinks they understand, but most don&#x2019;t really understand at all. Kind of like the usage of the word &#x201c;irony&#x201d; (isn&#x2019;t that ironic?). As a self-labeled &#x201c;social justice comedian,&#x201d; he spends a lot of his time trying to prove to people that this label makes sense. Sam is a dedicated ally and advocate, and blends humor into much of the work he does because he believes (like Mary Poppins believed) that sugar helps the medicine go down. Outside of It&#x2019;s Pronounced Metrosexual, Sam runs a non-profit he founded called Gamers Against Bigotry, is the co-creator of The Safe Zone Project, is always working on new social good projects, and likes to spend a least a couple hours a day cycling around sunny Austin, TX, where he counts himself as lucky to live.</p><h2>Mediterranean Sea (Oceans And Seas)</h2><p>Surveys the physical features, geological borders, climate and currents, water, plant and animal life, and economic and ecological aspects of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p></p><h2>The Grumpus Under the Rug</h2><p>A little boy claims that there is a Grumpus under the rug which causes all the mischief, but his mother does not believe him</p><p></p><h2>Eulogies</h2><p>A collection, culled from the past thirty years, of prose and oratory by a preeminent African-American literary figure celebrates such figures as James Baldwin, Miles Davis, Kimako Baraka, Dizzy Gillespie, and other black activists and artists.</p><p>One boring sectarian rant after another--astonishingly leavened and redeemed, at points, by real poetry. Baraka has compiled some 40 eulogies, many of which he delivered in person at memorial services. They celebrate world- famous artists, like Bob Marley and James Baldwin, as well as unsung local heros and heroines, like Joe Landrum, who worked two jobs so that his wife could be a community activist. Many commemorate Baraka's friends or relatives, his sister Kimako, for instance, who was murdered at the age of 48. Most of the figures memorialized here dedicated their lives to the kind of work Baraka admires: resistance to the white domination of US and world culture. Baraka can be tiresome; his Marxist/Leninist tirades against white capitalist imperialism and his exhortations to revolution, relentlessly repeated here, are utterly without originality; they have no literary merit, nor do they lend much insight into the people he is supposed to be eulogizing. Luckily, however, there is more to Baraka's writing than that. He is at his best when writing about jazz musicians. In these pieces his hectoring is transformed into a surreal prose, free-associative, rhythmic, and adventurous, like the noncommercial jazz he loves. Of the musician Don Pullen he says, ``Don spoke in a swirl of pictures. Like the voice of our mother the sky, when she is wet and on fire.'' Celebrating the technique of Miles Davis, he asserts that ``I was with you in that fingering, that slick turn and hang of the whole self and horn.'' Such moments, oases in Baraka's parched polemic, do make the collection a worthwhile read. Listening to Baraka is not unlike listening to music: Bursts of raw, spontaneous improvisation can light up--and begin to transform--even the most overplayed set. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A poet, playwright, essayist and critic, the prolific Baraka is perhaps best known as a founder of the Black Arts movement during the 1960s, and as an all-around cultural agitator. In his Newark neighborhood and among jazz musicians and other cultural figures, Baraka has also become a frequent eulogist, and this book collects more than 40. Perhaps because a eulogy is written mainly for the ear, most of these pieces do not work well as literature. Baraka too often relies on simplistic politics (AIDS is a conspiracy) and radical rhetoric ("Revolutionary Black intellectuals are dangerous to the status quo of the superpower imperialist domination"). Yet his anger at American injustice and his caring?especially for young Newarkites cut down before their prime?is palpable. Some of the eulogies, written in Baraka's free-form poetic style, might be powerful performance pieces: remembering jazzman "Philly" Joe Jones, Baraka rhymes "Jones" with "bones," leading to the image of drums. Among the well-known extolled here are Malcolm X, John Coltrane, James Baldwin, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Toni Cade Bambara, William Kunstler and Miguel Pi?ero. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II</h2><p>Presents a definitive, one-volume history of the great aerial campaigns of World War II, discussing the key air battles in the Pacific and European theaters, important military leaders and aviators, technological advancements, and other aspects of air combat.

While it focuses mainly on Spain and Portugal, it also examines the races and roots of the original North African before the later ethnic mix of the blackamoors and tawny Moors in the medieval period. The study ranges from the Moor in the literature of Cervantes and Shakespeare to his profound influence upon Europe&#39;s university system and the diffusion via this system of the ancient and medieval sciences. The Moors are shown to affect not only European mathematics and map-making, agriculture and architecture, but their markets, their music and their machines. The ethnicity of the Moor is re-examined, as is his unique contribution, both as creator and conduit, to the first seminal phase of the industrial revolution.</p><p>Ivan Van Sertima (1935-2009) was professor of African studies at Rutgers University.

This beautiful body of work is the result of a unique commission Meyerowitz received from the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation to document the city's parks. During the course of this project, Meyerowitz honed in on the 8,700 acres within the five boroughs of New York City that still exist in their original pristine state, as well as areas within parks that have been left to revert to wilderness. In creating this work, Meyerowitz has drawn on his own childhood memories of a New York that included "green space--open and wild, alive with rabbits, migratory birds, snakes, frogs and the occasional skunk--[that] gave me my first sense of the natural world, its temperament and its seasons, its unpredictability and its mystery." Through this rich compendium of images of parks, shorelines and forests, Meyerowitz's magnificent project transports the viewer into the heart of a lush wilderness, while contextualizing these nooks of nature as an inextricable part of city life today.<br><b>Joel Meyerowitz</b> (born in New York, 1938) is an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in over 350 exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world. He is a two-time Guggenheim fellow, a recipient of both NEA and NEH awards, as well as a recipient of the Deutscher Fotobuchpreis. He has published over 15 books, including <i>Cape Light</i> (1978) and <i>Aftermath: The World Trade Center Archive</i> (2006).

In his systematic tour of what is left of the city's natural landscape-and where it is even being enhanced, thanks to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's campaign to plant a million trees-Mr. Meyerowitz uncovers odd and charming hideaways that most native New Yorkers will not have visited or even heard of." -- Richard B.

Then again, for some fly-fishers, raising eyebrows is the whole point. Jack Samson has been saltwater fly-fishing for most of his career, and by now he might just be the most famous permit angler around. <i>Permit on a Fly</i> is the result of years spent perfecting a very difficult craft. It's hard enough to find permit, as they tail about on the saltwater flats rooting for crabs; then you have to execute a perfect cast with a perfect fly. And if you're masterful enough to induce a take... well, hang on! Sampson relates his years of chasing these magnificent game fish around exotic tropical locales, providing all of us hopeful permit anglers with some good instruction along the way.The Atlantic permit (Trachinotus falcatus), a member of the pompano family, spends part of each day in deep water; during the incoming tide, it moves up on the flats to feed on small crabs. A permit can weigh as much as 50 pounds. Easily spooked, the wary creature is the ultimate challenge to fly fishermen. Samson, former managing editor of Field &amp; Stream and author of Saltwater Fly Fishing, takes us from the Bahamas and the Florida Keys to Belize, Honduras and the Yucatan peninsula in search of this elusive fish. He gives here an engaging account of his adventures in locating, hooking and landing a permit on a fly?then releasing it. Colorful guides and fellow anglers add to the story. Samson offers advice on tackle and technique; an appendix gives information on tying flies for permit. A treat for anglers.

Weaving the stories of individual women together with systematic analysis of gendered litigation patterns, Cornelia Dayton argues that women&#39;s relation to the courtroom scene in early New England shifted from one of integration in the mid-seventeenth century to one of marginality by the eve of the Revolution. Using the court records of New Haven, which originally had the most Puritan-dominated legal regime of all the colonies, Dayton argues that Puritanism&#39;s insistence on godly behavior and communal modes of disputing initially created unusual opportunities for women&#39;s voices to be heard within the legal system. But women&#39;s presence in the courts declined significantly over time as Puritan beliefs lost their status as the organizing principles of society, as legal practice began to adhere more closely to English patriarchal models, as the economy became commercialized, and as middle-class families developed an ethic of privacy. By demonstrating that the early eighteenth century was a crucial locus of change in law, economy, and gender ideology, Dayton&#39;s findings argue for a reconceptualization of women&#39;s status in colonial New England and for a new periodization of women&#39;s history.</p><p>"Finely crafted. . . .

He decides to travel to the Wise Man of Kun-lun Mountain to seek advice. Along his journey he encounters three people who implore him to ask questions for them as well. When Yee-Lee reaches his destination, the Wise Man will only allow him to ask an odd number of questions. Yee-Lee then sets aside his own request to obtain answers for his new friends. As he returns home, the three answers each benefit him in turn; in the end Yee-Lee has learned that helping others can bring its own rewards. The story is an interesting variation on an old folklore motif, and the illustrations have a luminous quality with strong line and muted colors. There is plenty of action in the drawings for use with a group reading and much detail to please children reading alone. A well-designed book with a solid story, this is certain to become an old favorite. --Connie C. Rockman, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.A well-told, nicely balanced story with an admirable message. Hard-working Yee-Lee sets out to ask a wise man why he is so poor. En route, he agrees to ask the wise man questions for three others: the mother of a mute daughter, the owner of a barren fruit tree, and a dragon who yearns to ascend to heaven. Finding that the wise man will answer only three questions, Yee- lee omits his own--to find, of course, that the other answers have the effect of granting all he could wish for. In rough pencil and subtle colors, Chen's beautifully designed, stylized illustrations--an imaginative blend of references to Chinese art with simple forms like dePaola's--reflect the story's warmth and gentle humor.

Berge, Saint Laurent's partner since the couturier's sensational 1962 debut, writes a brief seven-page homage to Saint Laurent's artistry, followed by 52 photographs of his most significant designs, which changed women's fashions. Carefully selected, the illustrations also show the artworks and the environment that inspired Saint Laurent. Martin, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute, offers an insightful analysis of recently deceased Italian designer Versace's eye-opening fashions, which juxtapose silk with leather, street style with couture, in an unmistakable signature. Forty-nine photographs illustrate representative works of the last 15 years. Tretiack manages to summarize the house of Cartier's 150-year history into a succinct 16-page essay. While Cartier designed fancy clocks and desk accessories as well, it is the fabulous jewels that are featured here and that the reader will recognize. Certainly, these books do not approach some of the serious, in-depth publications of recent years (e.g., Yves Saint Laurent: Images of Design, 1958-1988, 1988. o.p.) or the weighty and expensive coffee-table tomes (e.g., Versace's Men Without Ties, Abbeville, 1996), but for libraries with small budgets, these quality publications can provide economical introductions to designers with whom most readers should be acquainted.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

Because of its one on one personal nature, it feels more important than it is. Competitive matches can become highly stressful, and losing is painful. Emotions tend to get out of hand, with fears and nerves becoming difficult to control. Confidence comes and goes; the scoring system is diabolical; everyone is at risk of choking, even the greatest players in the world. This book attacks these and other issues faced by players of all levels. Dr. Allen Fox's solutions are logical and straightforward, and most importantly, they have been tested and they work. <br>PARTIAL CONTENTS:<br> CH. 1: WHY DO WE WANT TO WIN?<br> Winning a tennis match feels more important than it is because players are genetically wired to compete for position on the social hierarchy. The emotions of a tennis match resemble those of a fight. Players may realize that winning a match doesn t really matter, but they will always want to win anyway. <br> CH. 2: THE EMOTIONAL ISSUES OF COMPETITION: <br>Tennis is inherently an emotional game. Because match outcomes feel important but are ultimately uncontrollable, matches can become stressful. There is often an unconscious urge to escape this stress, which leads to counterproductive behaviors, among which are anger, tanking, and excuse-making. These can be overpowered by the conscious mind, but it requires understanding, high motivation, and constant effort.<br> CH. 3: USING EMOTION TO HELP YOU WIN:<br> Your emotions will dramatically affect your tennis performance. We discuss how to keep counterproductive emotions in check and how to create productive ones that will help you win. Topics include the use of adrenalin, profiting from the time between points, and maintaining an optimal excitation level. <br>CH. 4: REDUCING THE STRESS: <br>Matches can become overly stressful, and this hinders performance. Stress can be reduced by developing a more realistic perspective of the game. Included are accepting outcomes that can t be controlled; resisting a narrow focus on winning; avoiding excessive perfectionism; getting over losses quickly; and using goals for hope and motivation rather than allowing them to become expectations and cause stress.<br> CH. 5: THE PROBLEMS OF FINISHING: <br>Most players become nervous and stressed when they are ahead and face the hurdle of finishing the match against a dangerous opponent. The unique tennis scoring system intensifies this problem. The closer players get to winning, the greater the stress. Trying to reduce it gives rise to counterproductive behaviors such as procrastinating the finish or becoming overconfident and easing up with a lead. <br>CH. 6: CHOKING - ITS CAUSES AND HOW TO MINIMIZE ITS EFFECTS:<br> Choking is most frequent at the finish of games, sets, and matches due to the uncertainty of outcome. You can limit choking damage by immediate acceptance of this uncertainty. Avoid stressful thoughts of winning by using rituals, focusing, and relaxation techniques. Rid yourself of the idea that choking will make you lose, and recognize that there are usually multiple opportunities to win, not just one. <br>CH. 7: CONFIDENCE AND HOW TO GET IT IF YOU DON T HAVE IT:<br> Confidence, aka self-belief, comes mostly from winning. Though it s more difficult, you can win without it by replacing it with sufficient emotional discipline. Slumps and hot streaks occur in cycles and both end naturally with time. Stressing over a slump prolongs it. You can speed its ending by several methods which we discuss. <br>CH. 8: GAME PLANS:<br>Game plans give your efforts direction and structure. They can rely primarily on offence or defense but should be consistent with your personality. With Plan A you are looking for a match-up where you have a relative advantage, most commonly pitting your strengths against an opponent's weakness.</p><p>Allen Fox, Ph.D. earned a B.A. degree in physics and a Ph.D. in psychology from UCLA where he won the NCAA Singles and Doubles titles and where he was named UCLA Athlete of the Year and All University of California Athlete of the Year.

Her paintings have been exhibited in galleries nationwide and her illustrations have graced the pages of numerous books for children, including <em> My Grandmother's Journey</em> by John Cech and <em> Pigs Will Be Pigs</em> by Amy Axelrod.Ages 3-5. This joyful picture book takes as its text the Christmas carol "The Friendly Beasts," in which the donkey, the cow, the sheep, the camel, and the dove tell of the parts they played in the Nativity story, ending with the verse "Thus every beast by some good spell, / In the stable dark was glad to tell / Of the gifts they gave Emmanuel, / The gifts they gave Emmanuel." Alive with color, movement, and the decoratively conceived forms of animals, angels, and people, the gouache paintings in a folk-art style echo the rhythmic sense of the carol. Repeated strokes of paint form strong, subtle dynamics within the paintings, while color and pattern brighten the wide, double-page spreads. The two closing spreads, illuminated as brightly with animal motifs as the preceding pages, include piano and guitar music, verses for the carol, and notes on the origins of the melody and the lyrics. A celebration of the season, this picture book invites those who share it to sing along. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His novels for Baen include the four novels in the New York Times best-selling Posleen War series (A Hymn Before Battle, Gust Front, When the Devil Dances, and Hell&#39;s Faire), the Council War series (There Will be Dragons, Emerald Sea, and Against the Tide), the novel Into the Looking Glass, four collaborations with New York Times bestselling author David Weber (March Upcountry, March to the Sea, March to the Stars and We Few) and two collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series: Hero (with Michael Z. Williamson) and the New York Times best seller Cally&#39;s War (with Julie Cochrane).Fans of Ringo's military SF epics (<i>Into the Looking Glass</i>) may at first think Mike Harmon, the hero of this unusual novel, is cut from the same cloth as Mike O'Neal from the Posleen War series (<i>Watch on the Rhine</i>, etc.). Like O'Neal, Harmon is a former Navy SEAL trying to adjust to civilian life who gets sucked back into action by circumstances, in particular by his witnessing the kidnaping of a college coed by jihadists. It becomes clear, though, that Harmon has a darker side, to which, by late in the book, as illustrated by a shocking scene in a Bosnian brothel, Harmon has almost completely surrendered. More techno-thriller than SF, this is a picaresque tale about a modern Barry Lyndon who resists, with equivocal results, baser instincts brought out by extreme stress. It's refreshing to find a successful popular writer who's not afraid to try something different, and the adventurous reader will find Ringo's latest insightful, exciting and outrageously funny. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gobbell featuring the World War II exploits of Cdr. Todd Ingram, commanding officer of the destroyer USS <i>Maxwell</i> (DD 525) who saves his ship when it is hit by a kamikaze off Okinawa. For repairs, they pull into Kerama Rhetto, Okinawa, where they receive news of the war's end. Ingram expects to be shipped home like the rest of his crew but instead receives orders to fly to Manila, where he is met by Brig. Gen. Otis Dewitt, an Army buddy from his days on Corregidor who is now intelligence aide to Gen. Richard K. Sutherland, chief of staff to General MacArthur. On Ingram's C-54 are sixteen Japanese senior military and civilian diplomats who meet with Sutherland to discuss formal surrender arrangements. Two days later the terms are settled and Ingram is working with one of the Japanese delegates to ensure that mines laid in Tokyo Bay are neutralized, allowing for safe passage of more than two hundred Allied ships. While Ingram is promised that he can attend the surrender ceremony on board the USS <i>Missouri</i> (BB 63), DeWitt, in concert with the State Department, has an ulterior motive and sends Ingram to Karafuto (Sakhalin Island, according to Soviet maps) to defuse a Soviet attack on Hokkaido, the northernmost home island of Japan. Ingram's old adversary, Edward Dezhnev, is the brigade commander responsible for laying siege to a Japanese holdout garrison in Toro, a natural jumping-off place for an attack on Hokkaido.<br><p>Also in Toro, DeWitt explains, is Walter Boring, a Red Cross representative holding two crates of overwhelming photographic evidence of Japan's experiments on live human beings in China. Ingram is expected to return with those crates, but how can he when Boring is being protected by the Japanese garrison in Toro, where Dezhnev and his troops stand ready to overpower them at any moment?<br></p><p>As his shipmates prepare to return to their loved ones, Ingram's war continues. Three weeks earlier he had been fighting the Japanese, and the Russians were supposed to be friends. Now he doesn't know whom to trust.</p></p><p>John J. Gobbell is a former Navy Lieutenant who saw duty as a destroyer weapons officer. His thirty plus year career in executive recruiting gave him added insight into character development for his novels. <i>The Edge of Valor</i> is the fifth of five stand-alone novels in the Todd Ingram series. Altogether, he has written seven historical thrillers involving the U.S. Navy - Pacific Theater --and is currently at work on his eighth. He and his wife, Janine, live in Newport Beach, California. His website is at www.JohnJGobbell.com and he can be reached at John@JohnJGobbell.com."This well-written, nicely researched historical novel begins just before World War II ends. Background information and the problems of those involved in the war and its end are woven throughout. The interplay of Japanese and Soviet interests as well as the problems of peacetime adjustment make this more than just another war novel."<b><i>--The Ensign</i></b><br><br><b>~ MILITARY WRITERS SOCIETY OF AMERICA "2015 GOLD MEDAL FOR HISTORICAL FICTION"</b><br><br>"This is author John J. Gobbell's fifth action/adventure novel set in World War II and continues the exploits of Todd Ingram. A deftly crafted and complexly woven storyline populated by memorable characters all presented by an extraordinarily talented writer, <i>Edge of Valor</i> is a compelling and wonderfully entertaining read which is highly recommended..."<b><i>--The Midwest Book Review</i></b><br><br>"Gobbell's exciting fifth Todd Ingram novel (after 2004's <i>The Neptune Strategy</i>) finds Ingram commanding the destroyer USS <i>Maxwell</i>, which comes under Kamikaze attack off the coast of Japan shortly after the second atomic bomb falls on Nagasaki. Following the Japanese surrender, Ingram thinks the end of the war in the Pacific means an imminent return to his wife and son stateside after years of combat, yet he quickly discovers otherwise. While Ingram's next assignment is to escort top Japanese military officials and diplomats on a flight to the Philippines to negotiate peace with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, his old comrade from Corregidor days, Brig. Gen. Otis DeWitt, has bigger plans for the war-weary commander. DeWitt dispatches him to Sakhalin Island, where the Soviets are preparing to launch an attack on Hokkaido. The heroic Ingram gets involved in plenty of intrigue as he seeks to thwart the Soviet threat. History and military buffs will be well rewarded."<br>--<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"<i>Edge of Valor</i> is John Gobbell at his finest, with a rapidly-paced historical thriller that will have readers turning pages at a furious rate. His portrayal of the war years in the Pacific and on the home front is brilliant and authentic down to the last detail."<br>--<b><i>Quarterdeck</i></b><br><br>"John Gobbell's latest book, <i>Edge of Valor</i>, is another triumph in this series. It is historical fiction at its best. He is a master of the details of the battle actions of our World War II destroyers and extends his tale to include the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union." --<b>Rear Adm. Hank McKinney, USN (Ret.), author of <i>Flotsam &amp; Jetsam</i></b><br><br>"Jack Gobbell knows how to tell a story, and <i>Edge of Valor</i> is a corking good one--combining the final days of World War II in the Pacific and the beginning of the Cold War. Gobbell skillfully weaves fascinating, well-drawn fictional characters into historical situations and thus makes a learning experience out of gripping drama. Along the way, he gives such real-life characters as Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Adm. Chester Nimitz, Adm. John S. McCain Sr., and even Arturo Toscanini walk-on parts that are often almost as interesting as his main characters. <i>Edge of Valor</i> is, in short, a compelling and well-researched work of historical fiction." --<b>Stanley Cloud, former Washington bureau chief of <i>Time</i> magazine and author of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Murrow Boys: Pioneers in the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism</i> and the novel <i>The Manhattan Well</i></b><br><br>"Far better than a yarn. <i>Edge of Valor</i> has vivid historical characters and heart. Like no other historical novel, it brings to life the new world order that followed World War II and is still emerging as the cause of turmoil in the western Pacific continues to shift."<br>--<b>Seth Cropsey, author of <i>Mayday: The Decline of American Naval Supremacy</i></b><br><br>"Having skippered his battered destroyer through deadly kamikaze attacks, twice Navy Cross recipient Todd Ingram is rewarded by Washington with a new and even more perilous secret mission. Gobbell will keep his readers up until dawn to discover if Ingram can possibly accomplish or even survive his hair-raising assignment to foil a bold Soviet planned invasion of Hokkaido from Sakhalin--before the ink is dry on Japan's surrender."<br>--<b>Pete Wilson, former governor of California and former U.S. senator (Armed Services Committee)</b></p><h2>An Interpretation of Religion: Human Responses to the Transcendent</h2><p>In this classic work, prominent religious philosopher John Hick presents a global interpretation of religion, arguing for a religious response to our ambiguous universe and showing how the world&#x2019;s different religions are culturally conditioned forms of that response.

The thoracic surgeon is best known for having developed the Heimlich Maneuver, the world&#39;s easiest-to-learn and most universally known method to save people from choking to death on food or foreign objects. But many don&#39;t know about Dr. Heimlich&#39;s other life-saving inventions. He is the inventor of the Heimlich Chest Drain Valve, which saved thousands of lives during the Vietnam War, and the Heimlich MicroTrach, which provides a remarkably efficient way for people to take oxygen. In the present decade, Dr. Heimlich has turned his attention to two devastating illnesses for which medicine has not yet found a cure--cancer and HIV. He describes his research and its promise, as well as the controversy and resistance his new ideas have generated from the medical establishment.Interweaving the author&#39;s personal life with riveting stories of his numerous medical breakthroughs, this rich memoir provides insights into the workings of a creative mind and the machinations of the American medical system.</p><p><b>Henry J. Heimlich, MD</b>, may have saved more lives over the course of his seventy-year medical career than any other living physician.&nbsp;A renowned thoracic surgeon, now retired, Dr. Heimlich&nbsp;is the president of the Heimlich Institute in Cincinnati. His many honors and awards include the Albert Lasker Award, the American Academy of Achievement Award, and induction into the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame and the Safety and Health Hall of Fame International.""As White House physician, I performed the Heimlich Maneuver on a choking guest in the State Dining Room at a holiday reception during the final year of President George H. W. Bush's term in office. Years later, at the Mayo Clinic, I performed the maneuver on a choking staff member.&nbsp;Thank you, Dr. Heimlich, for inventing this lifesaving method that has allowed me to save two lives.

Heimlich has saved countless lives. And, as we learn in the pages of this remarkable book, no one has ever lived a life remotely like the inspiring journey that has been Dr. Heimlich's.

By the author of The Quest for Saint Camber.</p><p>When we first met Kelson (in Kurtz's debut novel, <i>Deryni Rising</i>), he was fourteen and about to ascend to the throne of Gwynedd, the medieval realm that never was, where a small minority of the populace, the Deryni, have magical abilities.<p> Many novels later, King Kelson--in whom the Deryni blood flows strong--has come fully into his power and it is time to marry and begin the serious business of begetting heirs. Aficionados of The Deryni Chronicles will know that marriage and Kelson don't mix: his first betrothed was murdered on their wedding day and his second was tricked into marrying another. Now the young heir of Torenth, a rival kingdom, is about to be crowned, and securing Kelson's succession has become a matter of urgency--and intrigue. Kelson's mother, his friends, his ex-fianc�e, the mysterious Camberian Council, rival powers, and friendly allies all have their own candidates and agendas. With the future of Gwynedd at stake, Kelson has to learn to trust his enemies, use all his magic and might, and find a middle path between his duty as king and his feelings as a man. The king, like the author, succeeds admirably. <i>--Luc Duplessis</i></p>Katherine Kurtz has been writing fantasy for well over twenty-five years.

Eking out a living as a teacher&#x2019;s aide in a small New Mexican border town, T�a Regina is also raising her teenage nephew, Gabo, a hardworking boy who has entered the country illegally and aspires to the priesthood.

Milton is one of four transfixing voices telling the grim story of life along the border between the U.S and Mexico. Castillo writes fiction and poetry of earthy sensuality, wry social commentary, and lyrical spiritualism that confront the cruel injustices accorded women and Mexicans in America, legal and otherwise. In this tightly coiled and powerful tale, Regina, a virgin-widow in her fifties living in rural New Mexico, cares for her unusually disciplined teenage nephew, Gabo, who believes he's destined for the priesthood. Gabo's father often crosses the border to visit, but this time something has gone wrong, and given the gruesome fate of Gabo's mother, there is cause for alarm. As Gabo intensifies his prayers and penance, Regina, a teacher's aide unaware of her allure, asks Miguel, a chivalrous activist history teacher, for help, and he, in turn, enlists his covertly resourceful grandfather, Milton. At once shatteringly realistic and dramatically mystical, Castillo's incandescent novel of suffering and love traces life's movement toward the light even in the bleakest of places. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Brandishing her confederate lineage and tossing her red hair, she crosses the river near her Kentucky home in the mid-1940s, stepping out of her fundamentalist Baptist world, and setting convention on its ear. Across the river, Martha crashes the sacrosanct male preserve of the Miracle Inn, orders a beer, and seduces owner Bernie Miracle, a Catholic. Their unlikely marriage endures for 20 years, puzzling their Catholic neighbors because it produces only one offspring. Martha's dormant expectancies of life are stirred by a slick, philandering Yankee contractor, with whom she enjoys a liberating though scandalous affair. Though this is essentially the story of a woman's awakening, not so much sexually as in terms of her identity, there are other battles between the sexes here.

Shadowed by mountain peaks and untouched by time, Shangri-La is a hidden utopia, open only to the most worthy of humankind. The curious and the bold all come searching for paradise, but only a few find it.<br>Shangri-La is the chilling story of one such seeker. It is spring, 1966, and the atrocities of the Chinese Cultural Revolution have reached Tibet. General Zhang, of the invading People's Liberation Army, is a fortune hunter with plunder on his mind. Nothing is safe from him, especially Tibet's sacred treasures. His path of destruction and desecration leads him ever closer to the very heart of Tibet: Shangri-La.<br>Only one person can stop General Zhang: Hugh Conway, guardian of Shangri-La. As Zhang slowly decodes the riddles that shroud this earthly paradise, Conway must find a way to halt the general's determined progress, even if it means leaving his protected valley and sacrificing himself. Conway's unlikely ally is Zhang's daughter, a young officer in the Chinese army, who must choose between loyalty and love.</p><p>Cooney and Altieri, coauthors of two novels of historical China, The Court of the Lion (1989) and Deception (1993), attempt a sequel to the long-ago Lost Horizon. James Hilton's 1933 classic meant a great deal to a world struggling with worldwide depression and the rise of the Third Reich, because it portrayed a cultured, secret land without want, where everyone lived in harmony, no one grew old, and love might very well prove eternal. The reader was left with Hilton's Hugh Conway wandering the globe, trying to return to his paradise--a lovely metaphor, and one best untampered with, perhaps. In this follow-up, Conway did return and lived many happy and contemplative, if loveless, years. But as the 1960s arrive, Shangri-La is in peril: Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution is overtaking Tibet, purging it of all things holy. In command is General Zhang, a villainous but clever man who begins following a sort of map to Shangri-La that's been laid down in ancient temples to guide the worthy pilgrim. Conway must enter the outside world again to throw Zhang off the trail, which he does by providing false clues that lead to a place of sorcery and delusion. Conway may stay only ten days in the outside world without aging, but in that time he falls in love with a young girl, Zhang's daughter, Ma Li. Ma Li recalls the entire story from the vantage point of a saner time, 2007, before she embarks on her own, late-life quest for Shangri-La and her lost lover. A bit forced at times, and slow to meet Hilton's formidable challenge. But Zhang's unwitting evil quest rivals The Hobbit in its power and agony, and Conway's recollection of how he returned to Shangri-La is splendidly realized. As good as sequels get. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Much has changed in Tibet since James Hilton used it 63 years ago as the inspiration for Lost Horizon, his classic novel about Shangri-la, a spiritual paradise hidden in the Himalayas. Where monks once walked, Chinese troops now march; where temples once stood, rubble lies. In an unfortunate triumph of polemic over art, this sequel to Hilton's yarn hammers home these sad facts and a multitude more, at the expense of good writing. The novel's very structure indicates Cooney and Altieri's (Deception, 1994) disregard of storytelling principles: it's told in a confusion of time frames, first in the present of the late 1960s, then as a flashforward, then back to the present, then as a further flashback, then in the present once again. Hugh Conway, the British diplomat who in Hilton's original became high lama of Shangri-la, must reenter the world in order to foil a Chinese general who, in the midst of plundering Tibet, gets wind of the fabled land whose inhabitants can live for centuries. During his descent, Conway falls in love with a young Chinese woman. Risking sudden aging, he lingers with her, telling her how, after leaving Shangri-la three decades earlier for the brief exile that concluded the Hilton tale, he made his tortuous way back to his beloved oasis in the snows. It's only in Conway's flashbacked story that the authors touch the magic and excitement of the original. Otherwise, this is a well-meaning but ham-fisted sequel to a novel that needed none. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Alchemists</h2><p>Emrys, a human scholar, devises a plan to protect the Kin, a human-like race living on the planet Belthannis, from the Empire</p><p></p><h2>Schismatrix</h2><p>In Schismatrix, Bruce Sterling takes us on a high-velocity spin through the future of our species.

Putnam, a Wall Street banker, is in Gda&#x144;sk trolling for new investment opportunities when a whistle-blowing member of a European consortium turns up dead. In the course of solving the murder, Putnam also delivers a neat explanation of international finance, which is nearly as fascinating as the crime itself. Money, murder, and an exotic setting--Lathen delivers the goods with style and panache.Most murder mysteries are played out on a rather small stage. This murder is an international incident involving players from much of northern Europe. Still, it moves in the classic pattern, right down to the scene of explanations at the end for the sake of the reader who may have failed to follow all the twists of the plot. Garrick Hagon takes the listener through the story effortlessly with the firm touch of a seasoned professional. Both text and reading are characterized by workaday competence rather than any special flair, but devote�s of the John Putnam Thatcher series should be well satisfied.

The optimism of the Enlightenment and the belief among philosophers and scientists that the universe was both discoverable and rational made them feel invincible. Reason alone, declared the intellectuals, could discover a God of natural religion that was to replace the God of traditional Christianity. Pascal, on the other hand, was not so confident. In his Pensees, he wrote, &#34;The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.&#34; For Pascal, the universe was full of a mystery that went far beyond the powers of reason. Blaise Pascal: Reasons of the Heart, the latest addition to Eerdmans LIBRARY OF RELIGIOUS BIOGRAPHY series, captures Pascal&#39;s life and times with a chronicle narrative based on the published sources and Pascal&#39;s own works. Marvin O&#39;Connell takes readers on an eloquent journey into Pascal&#39;s world, showing the passion that drove the man and the radical spirituality he sought in his own heart. In the process, O&#39;Connell also illumines the social, political, and religious intrigue of seventeenth-century Paris, especially the winner-take-all struggle between the Jesuits and the Jansenists, with whom Pascal himself was allied. Written in an enjoyable style accessible to all, this meticulously researched biography will acquaint readers with the life and thought of Blaise Pascal, a remarkable human being and luminous Christian thinker.</p><p>This biography by Marvin R.

In the process, O&#39;Connell also illumines the social, political, and religious intrigue of seventeenth-century Paris, especially the winner-take-all struggle between the Jesuits and the Jansenists, with whom Pascal himself was allied.O'Connell (emeritus, history, Notre Dame) creates a context for understanding brilliant mathematician and mystic Blaise Pascal. The physical and intellectual environment of Pascal's 17th-century France come alive in this well-written work. Especially effective is O'Connell's analysis of the Jansenist controversy, in which Pascal was deeply involved and which profoundly influenced his thought. Although the book contains no footnotes, an eight-page bibliographic essay indicates that the author drew on an array of secondary sources as well as the standard published primary sources.

It was "the perfect storm"&#x2014;a tempest that may happen only once in a century&#x2014;a nor'easter created by so rare a combination of factors that it could not possibly have been worse. Creating waves ten stories high and winds of 120 miles an hour, the storm whipped the sea to inconceivable levels few people on earth have ever witnessed. Few, except the six-man crew of the <em>Andrea Gail</em>, a commercial fishing boat tragically headed toward the storm's hellish center.</p></p><p>Meteorologists called the storm that hit North America's eastern seaboard in October 1991 a "perfect storm" because of the rare combination of factors that created it. For everyone else, it was perfect hell. In <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, author Sebastian Junger conjures for the reader the meteorological conditions that created the "storm of the century" and the impact the storm had on many of the people caught in it. Chief among these are the six crew members of the swordfish boat the <i>Andrea Gail</i>, all of whom were lost 500 miles from home beneath roiling seas and high waves. Working from published material, radio dialogues, eyewitness accounts, and the experiences of people who have survived similar events, Junger attempts to re-create the last moments of the <i>Andrea Gail</i> as well as the perilous high-seas rescues of other victims of the storm. <p> Like a Greek drama, <i>The Perfect Storm</i> builds slowly and inexorably to its tragic climax. The book weaves the history of the fishing industry and the science of predicting storms into the quotidian lives of those aboard the <i>Andrea Gail</i> and of others who would soon find themselves in the fury of the storm. Junger does a remarkable job of explaining a convergence of meteorological and human events in terms that make them both comprehensible and unforgettable.</p><i>The Perfect Storm</i> is a winner of the first Alex Awards honoring the best adult books for teenagers, given by the Young Adult Library Services Association and <i>Booklist</i>.</p><h2>No Man&#39;s Land (John Puller Series)</h2><p><b>After his father is accused of murder, combat veteran and Special Agent John Puller must investigate his past and learn the truth about his mother in this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling thriller--but someone hiding in the shadows wants revenge.</b><br><br>Two men.

A major study by one of the leading modern dramatic critics. Introduction by Richard Gilman; new Afterword by the Author. Index.<br></p><p>Eric Bentley (born September 14, 1916 in Bolton, Lancashire, England) is a renowned critic, playwright, singer, editor and translator. He became an American citizen in 1948, and currently lives in New York City. In 1998 he was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame; he is also a member of the New York Theater Hall of Fame, in recognition of his years of performances in cabarets.<br><br> <p></p> <p>In addition to teaching at Columbia University, which he joined in 1953, Bentley was in the 1950s a theatre critic for <i>The New Republic</i>, known for his blunt style of theatre criticism. Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller threatened to sue Bentley for his unfavorable reviews of their work, but abandoned the attempt. From 1960-1961 Bentley was the Norton professor at Harvard University.<br><br></p> <p>Bentley met Bertolt Brecht at UCLA as a young man and is considered one of the pre-eminent experts on Brecht, whose work he has translated. He edited the Grove Press issue of Brecht's work, and made two albums of Brecht songs for the legendary Folkways Records label, most of which had never been recorded in English before.<br><br></p> <p>In 1969, Bentley came out of the closet and declared his homosexuality. In an interview in the <i>New York Times</i> on 12 November 2006, he says he was married twice before coming out at age 53, and deciding, at the same time, to leave his post at Columbia to concentrate on his writing. He has stated his being gay as an influence on his theater work, especially his play <i>Lord Alfred's Lover</i>.<br><br></p> <p>He has written many critical books, including <i>A Century of Hero-Worship</i>, <i>The Playwright as Thinker</i>, <i>Bernard Shaw</i>, <i>What is Theatre?</i>, <i>The Life of the Drama</i>, <i>Theatre of War</i>, <i>Brecht Commentaries</i>, and <i>Thinking about the Playwright</i>. He has also edited <i>The Importance Of Scrutiny</i> (1964), a collection of pieces from a now defunct critical magazine, and <i>Thirty Years of Treason: Excerpts from Hearings Before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, 1938&#x2013;1968</i> (1971). His most-produced play, <i>Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been</i> (more properly <i>Are You Now or Have You Ever Been: The Investigations of Show-Business by the Un-American Activities Committee 1947-1958</i>), published in 1972, was based on these texts. [1] Another play, <i>Lord Alfred's Lover</i>, treats on Oscar Wilde. </p></p><h2>Managing</h2><p>A half century ago Peter Drucker put management on the map. Leadership has since pushed it off. Henry Mintzberg aims to restore management to its proper place: front and center. &#x201c;We should be seeing managers as leaders.&#x201d; Mintzberg writes, &#x201c;and leadership as management practiced well.&#x201d; <br><br> This landmark book draws on Mintzberg&#x2019;s observations of twenty-nine managers, in business, government, health care, and the social sector, working in settings ranging from a refugee camp to a symphony orchestra. What he saw&#x2014;the pressures, the action, the nuances, the blending&#x2014;compelled him to describe managing as a practice, not a science or a profession, learned primarily through experience and rooted in context.<br> But context cannot be seen in the usual way. Factors such as national culture and level in hierarchy, even personal style, turn out to have less influence than we have traditionally thought. Mintzberg looks at how to deal with some of the inescapable conundrums of managing, such as, How can you get in deep when there is so much pressure to get things done? How can you manage it when you can&#x2019;t reliably measure it? <br><br> This book is vintage Mintzberg: iconoclastic, irreverent, carefully researched, myth-breaking. <i>Managing </i>may be the most revealing book yet written about what managers do, how they do it, and how they can do it better.</p><p>The definitive title on management from legendary and best-selling author Henry Mintzberg.Henry Mintzberg is Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies at McGill University in Montreal and the winner of awards from the most prestigious academic and practitioner institutions in management (Harvard Business Review, Academy of Management, Association of Management Consulting Firms, and others).

One of Mendelssohn's main concerns was how to conceive of the relationship between Judaism, philosophy, and the civic life of a modern state. Elias Sacks explores Mendelssohn's landmark account of Jewish practice&#x2015;Judaism's "living script," to use his famous phrase&#x2015;to present a broader reading of Mendelssohn's writings and extend inquiry into conversations about modernity and religion. By studying Mendelssohn's thought in these dimensions, Sacks suggests that he shows a deep concern with history. Sacks affords a view of a foundational moment in Jewish modernity and forwards new ways of thinking about ritual practice, the development of traditions, and the role of religion in society.</p></p><p><p>Elias Sacks is Assistant Professor of Religious Studies and Jewish Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p><p>"Elias Sacks's suggestion that Mendelssohn is philosophically motivated by the threat of historical consciousness to traditional Judaism is novel. A fresh, important, and exciting argument for the continued relevance of this founder of modern Jewish thought."</p> (Paul E. Nahme <i>Brown University</i>)<br><br><p>"Scholars will take issue with this or that in Sacks's arguments, but they will not be able to ignore his work. It forces a rethinking of Mendelssohn's thought at a time when attention is again being focused on this Jewish thinker.

But what exactly is it, and how is it applied? It is a discipline that claims not to be a discipline - a radical critical approach for understanding racial, national, social and gender identities. Introducing Cultural Studies provides an incisive tour through the minefield of this complex subject, charting its origins in Britain and its migration to the USA, Canada, France, Australia and South Asia, examining the ideas of its leading exponents and providing a flavour of its use around the world. Covering the ground from Gramsci to Raymond Williams, postcolonial discourse to the politics of diaspora, feminism to queer theory, technoculture and the media to globalization, it serves as an insightful guide to the essential concepts of this fascinating area of study. It is essential reading for all those concerned with the quickening pulse of old, new and emerging cultures.</p><p>Ziauddin Sardar is a hugely renowned writer, broadcaster, journalist and critic. &#39;Britain&#39;s own Muslim polymath&#39; (Independent) has become one of the UK&#39;s leading intellectuals and writes on a huge variety of subjects in numerous newspapers and magazines throughout the world.

In this beautifully written tale, a promising young politician, Grant Arliss, flees from his complicated and pressure-ridden life in New York City to the serenity of the desert&#39;s open spaces, finding a love and a landscape that will change his life.</p><p>Mary Austin (1868-1934) wrote more than 30 books during her career, including Land of Little Rain (1903) and Lost Borders (1909). Born in Carlinsville, Illinois, Mary Austin eventually ventured west with her brother and widowed mother to homestead in California. Throughout her essays, poems, plays, and stories, she focused on environmental issues and the relationship between individual experience and cultural histories.Formal in its dialogue, passionate and romantic in its evocation of the Southwest, where the central action takes place, this slender novella is at heart a feminist tract. The boy-meets-girl openinghe, Grant Arliss, a socialist politician from New York, she, Dulcie Adelaid, as skilled as an Indian in tracking the desert where she was raisedpromises a happy ending. But subtle clues signal otherwise: the eponymous cactus thorn, a tiny dagger with which Dulcie kills a snake rearing toward Grant, and Dulcie's conviction that one must act according to one's beliefbeliefs that she thinks Grant's socialism espouses and that his own life should reflect. The splendor of the desert and of their love for each other is disturbed when a drunken man appears and demands to see Dulcie. Grant sends him, through a murderous sandstorm, in the wrong direction; later, Dulcie reveals that he is her husband. Events then careen wildly to the shocking and yet logicalwithin its feminist ideology resolution. Written in 1927 and never before published, the story is timeless in setting and moral tone. Like Austin's other novels ( Earth Horizon , Land of Little Rain ), it is a powerful enactment of a woman's need to choose between a man and the land she loves. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I &amp; II Corinthians</h2><p>A MESSAGE FOR TODAY FROM I &amp; II CORINTHIANS The ancient city of Corinth represents both tremendous spiritual need and tremendous potential as a strategic location for evangelization. Recognizing the unique opportunity of this city, the apostle Paul spent more than two years ministering there, and remained in contact with the Corinthian church long after his departure. In addition to a strong emphasis on edification of the church through spiritual gifts, Paul's letters to the church at Corinth deal directly with a number of other issues also facing us today. In this Logion Commentary, Stanley M. Horton takes an in-depth look at the history, customs, word meanings, and contemporary application of Paul's letters to the church at Corinth.</p><p></p><h2>Before and After</h2><p><br>Beautifully written, compassionate and wise, Rosellen Brown&#x2019;s novel is the extraordinary story of a family&#x2019;s struggle to survive the throes of a tragedy. <i>Before and After </i>centers on Carolyn and Ben Reiser and their two children, Judith and Jacob, who live comfortably in a small New England town. When the chief of police comes looking for seventeen-year-old Jacob to question him about the bludgeoning to death of his girlfriend, the Reisers&#x2019; lives are changed forever. Before and After is the compelling drama of the search for Jacob, his capture, and the chain of events set in motion by a brutal crime of passion. It is a story that pits parent against parent, brother against sister, family against community, blood loyalty against the law. With a flawless ear for dialogue and profound understanding of character and motive, Rosellen Brown has written a heart-wrenching novel that questions the very nature of violence in our society and our ability to ever really know our children.<br><br></p><p>The Reisers were a typical American family. Two loving parents. Two bright teenagers. A lovely home in a small New England town.

But when the coded messages are in a language as complex as Japanese, decoding problems multiply dramatically. <p>It took the U.S. Army a full two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor to break the codes of the Japanese Imperial Army. But by 1944 the U.S. was decoding more than 20,000 messages a month filled with information about enemy movements, strategy, fortifications, troop strengths, and supply convoys. </p><p>In MacArthur's ULTRA, historian Edward Drea recounts the story behind the Army's painstaking decryption operation and its dramatic breakthrough. He demonstrates how ULTRA (intelligence from decrypted Japanese radio communications) shaped MacArthur's operations in New Guinea and the Philippines and its effect on the outcome of World War II. </p><p>From sources on both sides of the Pacific and national security agency declassified records, Drea has compiled a detailed listing of the ULTRA intelligence available to MacArthur. By correlating the existing intelligence with MacArthur's operational decisions, Drea shows how MacArthur used--and misused--intelligence information. He tells for the first time the story behind MacArthur's bold leap to Hollandia in 1944 and shows how ULTRA revealed the massive Japanese mobilization for what might have been (had it occurred) the bloodiest and most protracted engagement of the entire war--the Allied invasion of Japan. Drea also clarifies the role of ULTRA in Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, and concludes that ULTRA shortened the war by six to ten months. </p><p>This book is part of the <i>Modern War Studies</i> series.</p></p><p>In this book, the author assesses the relationship between special intelligence and the campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific. During World War II, special intelligence, commonly referred to as ULTRA today, meant information obtained through monitoring, intercepting, and decoding enemy radio communications.Edward J.

He lived an unhappy and difficult life during which his work received almost no appreciation&#x2014;finally killing himself by a bullet to the chest, so great was his despair&#x2014;and is now widely considered one of the most important painters of all time, his works fetching record prices of tens of millions of dollars at auction. This comprehensive study of Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) represents a rarity in art history: <b>a detailed monograph on his life and art combined with a complete catalogue of his 871 paintings</b>.

"Waiting for the right time to quit, the motivation? Well, there is none," writes Susan Powter in her characteristically direct but chatty style. It's the Powter magic that makes accessible--even persuasive--what has been known in the field for almost 40 years: alcoholism is a biochemical disease. If that's the case, Powter asks in <i>Sober ... and Staying That Way</i>, then why the adamant belief that alcoholism is incurable? Powter's combination of personal disclosure, expos�, and a program for lasting recovery looks soberly at the biochemical and psychological components of alcoholism. <p> Powter's national prominence as a fitness expert and author of <i>Stop the Insanity!</i> made her disclosure all the more difficult. But it's when Prowter recollects her famous struggle with obesity, drawing from the lessons of goal setting and values searching, that <i>Sober</i> acquires credibility. There was not, she remembers, any instant cure, nor should there be for alcoholism. Recalling the discipline and self-education that preceded her dramatic weight loss, Powter discovered a vitamin-based nutrition program with an 80 percent recovery rate. </p><p> Powter presents facts unforgetably: "Did you know that alcohol is one of the richest foods known to man?... This stuff is amazing. It's got calories, it's a food, it gives you energy, but ... it's a food with only calories, nothing else.... Malnutrition. You and I are malnourished." Smart and upbeat--a combination of Powter's triumph over her ordeal with the biochemical and psychological components of recovery--<i>Sober ... and Staying That Way</i> is like a 12-step personal trainer.</p><p>Millions of people are alcoholics and countless more family members, friends, and loved ones are affected by this insidious disease. </p><p>As an eleven-year-old child in a family ravaged by alcoholism, Susan Powter was one of the youngest members of Alanon. In recent years she has had to confront this disease in herself. Her national prominence as a fitness expert and the author of <i>Stop the Insanity!</i> (twenty weeks on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list, including nine weeks at number one) made this all the more difficult and shameful for her. But with the same fierce determination that took her on a journey to understand and cure her own obesity, she set out to find the answers to her own alcoholism. </p><p>For almost forty years it has been known that alcoholism is a biochemical disease. In extreme exasperation, Powter asks the question, "Why have we just accepted the fact that there is no cure for alcoholism and that the only treatment available is through organizations like AA? Disease talk doesn't cure." Some experts say that Alcoholics Anonymous has a 7 to 12 percent recovery rate. Illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer all have treatments. We wouldn't stand for inactivity in the medical professions when it comes to these diseases, so why, Powter asks, do we stand for it when it comes to alcoholism? In <i>Sober...and Staying That Way: The Missing Link in the Cure for Alcoholism,</i> Powter exposes the truth behind the years of documented research into alcoholism. </p><p>For the first time, Susan Powter tells the story of her search for answers. What she found was the missing link in a cure for alcoholism. She discovered a vitamin-based nutrition program that has yielded an 80 percent recovery rate. By combining this vitamin-based treatment with other crucial components -- overcoming the shame associated with the disease, proper eating, exercise, and education -- Powter devised a program that cured her and will work for millions of others. </p><p>Powter's book is at once a personal story, an expos�, and a program for lasting recovery. As Powter puts it, her book "will take the reader out of the lies and into the truth so that alcoholism can be brought out of the closet and into the light."</p></p><h2>The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Vol. 9: 1668-1669</h2><p>The final volume of the complete Diary of Samuel Pepys in its most authoritative and acclaimed edition. This complete edition of the Diary of Samuel Pepys comprises eleven volumes - nine volumes of text and footnotes (with an introduction of 120 pages in Volume I), a tenth volume of commentary (The Companion) and an eleventh volume of Index. Each of the first eight volumes contains one whole calendar year of the diary, from January to December. The ninth volume runs from January 1668 to May 1669. The Diary was first published in abbreviated form in 1825. A succession of new editions, re-issues and selections, published in the Victorian ear, made the diary one of the best-known books, and Pepys one of the best-known figures, of English history. But in none of these versions - not even in the Wheatley, which for long stood as the standard edition - was there a reliable, still less a full text, and in none of them was there a commentary with any claim to completeness. This edition was in preparation for many years, and remains the first in which the entire diary is printed and in which an attempt has been made at systematic comment on it. The primary aim of the principal editors was to see that the diary was presented in a manner suitable to the historical and literary importance of its contents. At the same time they had in mind the interests of the wide public of English-speaking people to whom the diarist himself, rather than the importance of what he wrote, is what matters.</p><p>Robert Latham, cbe, ma, fba -- Fellow and Pepys Librarian, Magdalene College, Cambridge, and formerly reader in History, Royal Holloway College, University of London.

In a lively, informal fashion, Ireland ( Mostly Mules ) regales readers with tales of the eccentricities of the region's natives; of trying to make ends meet by working at a cement-block plant; of the travails of building a house and digging a well; and of time spent immersed in nature raising sheep, obsessing over the significance of ravens and domesticating a magpie. Ireland has an sharp eye for nuance, whether he's describing the disease infecting his beloved willow trees--"those wormy bumps, or blisters, as if a great, sudden heat had passed, searing the bark of the willows and raising multitudes of tiny welts"--or washing his daughter's hair--"How she screams and hollers! How sweet and clean and obedient she is when it's done! Saying, in these very words, 'I'll do anything you tell me to do.' " This collection offers a refreshing account of Ireland's experience in the American West, one whose appeal is delightfully idiosyncratic and universally human. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.One persistent form of the American dream is to flee the urban area in search of a simpler and thus somehow more satisfying life in a remote area. Some excellent literature has resulted from this experience, and Ireland continues the tradition. After moving to La Madera, New Mexico, in the mid-1970s, he built a home, nurtured a family, quarreled with his neighbor over water rights, lived in fear of the menacing "bad boys" who drank beer in a parking area nearby, and eight years later moved to Santa Fe. Ireland is a fine writer--introspective but articulate, sensitive to his environment, and brutally frank.<br><i>- Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

After studying illustration at the University of Technology, Sydney, she traveled to London, where she has been making a mess ever since. Her projects include album artwork, websites, ad campaigns, and, of course, picture books.PreS-K&#x2014;Children appreciate repetition and routine, and when these themes are nestled in a sweet story about friendship and self-discovery that also inserts counting possibilities, a review of colors, and the chance to travel through the seasons, an engaging as well as informative debut picture book has been created. Lucy Ladybug wants to be like the other ladybugs, but she has no black spots. Lonely and sad, she leaves the other ladybugs behind, but as she wanders alone, in each season she encounters a different creature with an alliterative name (Fred Frog, Carla Caterpillar, Felicity Fish, and Bella Bird) who is willing to share a colorful spot with Lucy and who makes her feel better about herself. Each creature points out one feature that makes Lucy special and repeats two empowering phrases that every child needs to hear: YOU are beautiful too and I wish I could be like you. Reminiscent of David McKee's Elmer and Marcus Pfister's The Rainbow Fish, the tale ends with a large, colorful foldout that contains a message of diversity and acceptance.

Through his inspired storytelling and graceful paintings, author Phap Ban tells the story of his journey in pursuit of happiness and self-acceptance,&nbsp;from successful Disney artist and writer to monk at the&nbsp;Plum&nbsp;Village&nbsp;international community of spiritual seekers and peace activists. Visually striking and deeply poetic, each page of&nbsp;<i>Plum&nbsp;Village: An Artist's Journey</i>&nbsp;is a beautiful guide to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh and a testimony to his profound spiritual legacy as seen through the eyes of a devoted&nbsp;disciple.</p><p>Born in Genoa in 1960, <b>Phap Ban</b> started to publish comic books for <i>Furia</i>, <i>Intrepido</i>, and other magazines during high school. He worked as a freelance illustrator during university, and then, at twenty-four, he discovered meditation. This ultimately led him to Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh and the monastery he founded in France, Plum Village. Ban lived in Plum Village for ten years, first as a layman, then as a monk. He received complete ordination in 2010. When he returned to Italy in 2013, he resumed his creative work, this time as an artist for Disney. He has also taught courses at the Academy of Fine Arts in Genoa and at the Lecce School of Cartoon.&#x201c;What Ban has created with &#x2018;Plum Village&#x2019; is a visual love letter not just to Plum Village, but his journey while there. Somehow in riotous colors he captures the heart of stillness. With a beautiful montage of imagery, he demonstrates depths of gratitude. Never underestimate the power of images paired with words...

Early Cycladic objects, once viewed as archaeological curiosities, are today a source of widespread fascination and appeal. Their simple lines and spare elegance inspired such modern artists as Brancusi, Modigliani, and Picasso. Knowledge of Cycladic civilization has been fathomed through its artifacts, since there was no written language to help archaeologists. Curator Dr. Pat Getz-Gentle, an author and scholar who has devoted her professional life to the field, has written the essay for the comprehensive catalogue in which she puts forth the latest findings and her own theories on Early Cycladic culture. 64 pp.</p><p></p><h2>Teen Titans Vol. 1: Blinded by the Light</h2><p>Red Robin, Wonder Girl, Raven, Bunker and Beast Boy step out of the shadows of the adult heroes of the DC Universe to offer bold, exciting and sometime dangerous ideas on how to protect a world full of superpowered teenagers--any one of whom could be the next heroic figure or major villain!<br><br>This exciting new chapter in the teen heroes' mythos starts here in TEEN TITANS VOL. 1, written by Will Pfeifer (CATWOMAN) and illustrated by Kenneth Rocafort (SUPERMAN, RED HOOD AND THE OUTLAWS).<br><br>Collects TEEN TITANS #1-7.</p><p>Will Pfeifer began his writing career on FINALS, a well-received Vertigo miniseries he did in collaboration with Jill Thompson. Since then, his writing has appeared in numerous titles for DC Comics, including TEEN TITANS, CATWOMAN, AQUAMAN, BLOOD OF THE DEMON, H-E-R-O, CAPTAIN ATOM: ARMAGEDDON, and WONDER WOMAN.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Red Robin, Wonder Girl, Raven, Bunker, and Beast Boy are teenage superheroes who fight against the kind of enemies readers might expect&#x2014;terrorists, robots, evil geniuses, and teens who want to use their own abilities for destructive purposes. But they also have other challenges that are affecting their lives. Wonder Girl discovers that she has a fan club of girls who dress like her and want to fight for vigilante justice, but they don't have superpowers, so she feels obligated to protect them. Plus, her mother comes to New York for a surprise visit, and the superheroine has to keep her from harm's way, too. Bunker is defensive about other people's homophobic attitudes, and his violent tirade is recorded and shared with the world. Raven just wants to be an ordinary girl sometimes but finds it difficult to remain incognito. And Red Robin is the only one in the group with no superpowers, and he has to rely on his wits to survive. Rocafort and Hepburn's artwork is colorful, imaginative, and dynamic, especially when illustrating fight scenes and the many entertaining forms that Beast Boy takes throughout the story. VERDICT An exciting volume about teen superheroes who work together to deal with life-or-death problems; a good choice for "Teen Titans" fans as well as readers who are new to the franchise.&#x2014;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</p><h2>Religion and Hopi Life, Second Edition (Religion in North America)</h2><p><p>Religion and Hopi Life tells the story of Hopi religious life in a way that makes sense to both Hopis and outsiders. In his interpretation of Hopi religion, John D. Loftin does not subject religious meaning to secular analysis. While not the Hopi&#x2019;s own story, his account attempts to honor and do justice to the way in which the Hopi embody religious meaning through the living of their lives. The second edition of this highly praised book keeps scholarly debates and theories to a minimum, except when they help illuminate the understanding of Hopi religious orientation and worldview. Several important studies of the Hopi have emerged since the book&#x2019;s first publication, and their findings have been incorporated. The book also includes new material on shamanism, death, witchcraft, myth, tricksters, and kachina initiations. This updated edition incorporates other minor corrections and additions to the text, and revises and expands the footnotes and the annotated bibliography.</p></p><p><p>JOHN D.

When you do not fear God, he contends, you will not fear sin. The troubling result of this issue is that many Christians fail to recognize that they have sinned against God. The lack of holiness within the Church has reached epidemic levels. "True revival can only come," notes Blackaby, "when the people of God return to a healthy, holy fear of Him."</p><p>God, in His holiness, is grieved by our lack of it. In this worthy book, Blackaby urges believers to look inward, to see sin from God's perspective, and to live to the standard that He has set in Scripture. He writes, "The salvation of the nation has little to do with Washington or Hollywood-it has to do with the people of God!" As referenced in 2 Chronicles 7:14, Blackaby notes that the redemption of America lies in the repentance of the people of God. He challenges readers by adding, "If America depended on your prayer life, would there be revival?" Revival waits on the holiness of His people; this book provides the path that will lead us back.</p></p><p>Henry Blackaby is the author of over a dozen books, including the bestselling Experiencing God Bible studies. Dr. Blackaby is a graduate of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. He has completed his Th.M. degree from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary. He has also received four honorary degrees and is now serving as the president of Henry Blackaby Ministries.This title is slightly misleading. HOLINESS is not about righteousness or purity of spirit, but rather the need to fear and avoid sin. An old-fashioned jeremiad, it judges the community of the faithful and points out how they've strayed from God's path. The work will appeal to a limited audience; even many fundamentalist Christians will take issue with some of Blackaby's judgments. His stance in no way reflects upon Mel Foster's superior delivery. Foster understands the rhythms of the pulpit and the rhythms of this text in particular. His narration moves smoothly back and forth between a measured pace and a rousing call to salvation, and can powerfully evoke both anger and compassion.

Custer, Volume 1: Through the Civil War</h2><p>In the election year of 1876 the Battle of the Little Big Horn was horrifyingly fresh to opinion makers, who divided along political lines in assigning blame. The late General George A. Custer, who had been a Democrat with aspirations to high office, was more pilloried than praised by President Grant and influential editors of Republican newspapers. Coming to the defense of Custer was Frederick Whittaker, who less than six months after the disaster published this first biography of him. <i>A Complete Life</i> was the beginning of a legend, and Whittaker did more than anyone else except Libby Custer to make the flamboyant Boy General a permanent resident of the national consciousness. <p>Quite aside from its contribution to the public image of Custer, this important book placed him and his associates against a concrete background of onrushing events. Drawing on newspaper reports and the general's own words, Whittaker captures the excitement of the era. In Volume 1 a boy's life in Ohio is made immediate. Then Custer's escapades as a cadet at West Point (where he was called Fanny because of his golden locks), his courtship of Judge Bacon's saucy daughter, and his singular service as a cavalryman in the Civil War are described in vivid circumstantial detail. From the first Battle of Bull Run through Gettysburg and the Virginia campaign he is seen in action, conspicuously defying death and winning promotion. Volume 2 deals with Custer's fighting in the West, ending with a memorable description of his last stand at the Little Big Horn in June 1876.</p><p>The introduction to Volume 1 is by Gregory J. W. Urwin, who won praise for <i>Custer Victorious: The Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer</i>, also a Bison Book.</p></p><p>Gregory J. W.

He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators.

After letting the two into the squat, Benjamin promised to help change the lock if they stayed for a week. Afterwards I skipped to keep pace as, with a crowbar dangling from his pinkie, Benjamin lumbered about the neighborhood in search of more squats. Homelessness and the Growth of U.S. Squatting Homes Not Jails began with the wave of other homeless activist groups that sprouted nation-wide following the economic recession of the 1980s. As a result of soaring rents, small-business failures, and massive corporate layoffs, landlords evicted thousands onto the streets. These new homeless, who were often well-educated, drug and alcohol free, mentally stable and middle class, joined the traditional homeless population that more often suffered mental or substance-abuse problems. Hundreds of homeless organizations sprouted across the nation that used squatting as a tactic, like Community on the Move Homesteaders Association in the Bronx, Mad Housers in Atlanta and Chicago, Drop in Center in Cincinnati, Homes Not Jails in San Francisco, and similar groups in almost every major U.S. urban area. Groups in New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Oakland successfully acquired title to several squatted properties. By opening vacant buildings like the one on Shotwell and 22nd, Homes Not Jails hopes to provide at least some shelter for the growing number of homeless. Between 1992 and 1998, available housing in San Francisco fell from a high of 6,500 vacant buildings (enough to house the City's entire homeless population) to less than one percent of the total housing stock. In 1994, estimates of San Francisco's homeless population were as high as 14,000, and through 1996, the number grew by 300 per month. One hundred and fifty homeless people died on the streets of San Francisco that year. Between the last quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997, the number of San Francisco homeless families doubled. Boston, where Homes Not Jails is also active, has thousands of vacant buildings that could solve the City's homeless problem. In December 1995, less than three weeks after the first HNJ Boston action, the Boston Emergency Shelter Commission counted 4,896 homeless people. Many homeless advocates placed the number much higher. According to HNJ Boston, there are "thousands of residential units-largely derelict or foreclosed-which lie vacant and could be used for low-income housing or homesteading." The Power and Ethics of Media-Savvy Squatters Homes Not Jails describes itself as an all-volunteer organization committed to housing homeless people through direct action. "It is clear to me that it is possible to house everybody in San Francisco," said Miguel Wooding, a member of HNJ and volunteer tenant counselor at the San Francisco Tenants Union. "It is clear that by pressing on the issues of abandoned, vacant, tax-default buildings, we can make housing a right to which everyone has access." With the power that public takeovers provide HNJ's media spokespersons, HNJ drives their message home to the general public. "Which Do You Believe?" questions one Homes Not Jails Flyer. "1) People Who Are Homeless Should Fix Up &amp; Live in Vacant Buildings. 2) Leave Buildings Boarded Up &amp; Vacant; People Can Sleep Outside." HNJ's tongue in cheek rhetorical question sums-up their philosophy: common sense demands that vacant homes should house the homeless. But common sense is not so common, wrote some big-name philosopher. Even many homeless people consider squatting ethically or morally questionable, not to mention police, landlords, government figures and members of the general public. "People are scared to go open houses." said Connie, a 21 year-old who ran away from home at age fourteen in Israel and started squatting with a gang of other Israeli kids. "Squatting is a violation of everyone's basic idea of society. Property is sacred. When you open a building you are violating someone's property." When I asked Graham, who quit his office job to become a full-time homeless activist and squatter, how he would react to landlords calling him a thief, he flung that epithet right back. "For them to say that we steal their unused property, while they speculate on the rental market, is criminal. They steal when they charge us rent, as opposed to us stealing when we squat. We should not ask whether it is a crime to 'steal' a piece of property, but whether it is a crime to charge rent."</p><h2>The Alchemy of Touch: Moving Towards Mastery Through the Lens of Zero Balancing</h2><p>Fritz Smith is the founder of Zero Balancing. In his latest book, Alchemy of Touch, he uses the &#34;lens&#34; of zero balancing to help practitioners move toward mastery in energy-based body work. Rather than a procedural manual, Alchemy of Touch is a guide to the universal principles of using touch to heal and enable ourselves and others. The book begins with a fascinating description of Dr. Smith&#39;s own spiritual journey and awakening to the power of spirit and the benefit of touch. In his experiences with Ida Rolf, J.R. Worsley, and initiation by Swami Muktananda, we see the roots of Zero Balancing in the on-going revelation of his life. By sharing his personal journey in his own words, he establishes a foundation that invites the reader into a deeper exploration of touch and healing. Each of the seven session chapters is interspersed with Fritz&#39;s expert observations about body work. Using Zero Balancing as a focus for experience, Fritz engages topics that broaden and deepen our understanding of the essential interchanges in body work-- for example, energetic fields and their relationship to the body-mind, the integration of energy and structure, how memory is retained in the body, and the various alchemies of body work. Like yin and yang, these alternating chapters make an integrated whole that advances our understanding of the body and our influences upon it.</p><p></p><h2>Extraordinary Canadians Glenn Gould</h2><p>Glenn Gould, one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most renowned classical musicians, was also known as an eccentric genius&#x2014;solitary, headstrong, a hypochondriac virtuoso. Abandoning stage performances in 1964, Gould concentrated instead on mastering various media: recordings, radio, television, and print. His sudden death at age fifty stunned the world, but his music and legacy continue to inspire. Philosopher and critic Mark Kingwell regards Gould as an innovative thinker whose ideas about music governed his life. But those ideas were contradictory, mischievous, and deliberately provocative. Just as Gould played twenty-one &#x201c;takes&#x201d; to record the opening aria in the famed 1955 Goldberg Variations, Kingwell offers twenty-one takes on Gould&#x2019;s life. Each version offers a different interpretation of the man, but in each, Kingwell is sensitive to the complex harmonies and dissonances that sounded throughout the life of the great Gould.</p><p>Philosopher and critic&nbsp;<b>Mark Kingwell</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than ten books, including the national bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Better Living</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The World We Want</i>.

Twenty-four macabre tales include the nerve-twisting novelette The Mist by Stephen King. Previously published in mass market by Bantam.</p><p><i>Dark Forces</i> is one of the greatest collections of original horror stories published since World War II, and it may prove to be one of the most influential anthologies of its kind, ever. Edited by award-winning editor (and recognized authority) Kirby McCauley, this was the first superstar collection of famous horror writers. It has been often imitated but never surpassed. McCauley was inspired by another landmark collection; his goal was to publish an anthology "with the same scope and dynamism of Harlan's Ellison's <i>Dangerous Visions</i>, but in the supernatural horror field." <i>Dark Forces</i> succeeds on every level, especially in the selection of the 24 contributors, a "Who's Who" from across the spectrum of imaginative literature: Richard Matheson, Dennis Etchison, Ramsey Campbell, Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Joyce Carol Oates, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Oh, yes, also found here is the first appearance of an unforgettable short novel called "The Mist" by an up-and-comer named Stephen King. <i>Dark Forces</i> belongs on the shelf of anyone who desires the very best the field has to offer. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>Western life &amp; adventures in the great Southwest</h2><p>In this collection of colorful, well-told stories, Elliott Barker shares with the reader his experiences of living nearly all of his 88 years in the mountain-forest country of New Mexico.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br><br><br>"Advantage, Starbuck."<br><br>Isn't it always? Asher mused. For a moment the large arena held that humming silence peculiar to indoor sports events. There was an aroma of roasted peanuts and sweat. The overhead lights heated the scent somewhat pleasantly while the crush of bodies added enforced camaraderie. A small child sent up a babbling complaint and was hushed.<br><br>Seated several rows back at mid-court, Asher Wolfe watched Ty Starbuck&#x2014;tennis master, Gypsy, eternal boy of summer and former lover. She thought again, as she had several times during more than two hours of play, that he'd changed. Just how wasn't yet completely clear. More than three years had passed since she'd seen him in the flesh. But he hadn't aged, or thickened, or lost any of his characteristic verve.<br><br>Rarely over the years had she watched a televised match&#x2014; it was too painful. Too many faces were familiar, with his the most strictly avoided. If Asher had chanced to come across a write-up or picture of him in the sports pages or in a gossip column, she had immediately put it aside. Ty Starbuck was out of her life. Her decision. Asher was a very decisive woman.<br><br>Even her decision to come to the U.S. Indoor Tennis Championship had been a cool-headed one. Before making this trip, she had carefully weighed the pros and cons. In the end logic had won. She was getting back into the game herself. On the circuit, meetings with Ty would be unavoidable. She would see him now, letting the press, her colleagues and fans see clearly that there was nothing left of what had been three years before. Ty would see too, and, she hoped fervently, so would she.<br><br>Ty stood behind the baseline, preparing to serve. His stance was the same, she mused, as was his sizzling concentration. He tossed the ball up, coming back and over with the wicked left-handed serve that had become synonymous with his name, a Starbuck.<br><br>Asher heard the explosion of his breath that forced the power into it. She held her own. A lesser player than the Frenchman, Grimalier, would never have gotten a racket on the ball. His return was quick&#x2014;force meeting force&#x2014;and the rally began.<br><br>The crowd grew noisier as the ball smashed and thudded. Echoes bounced crazily. There were cries of encouragement, shouts of appreciation for the prowess of the two players. Ty's basic entertainment value hadn't decreased since Asher had been out of the game. Fans adored or detested him, but they never, never ignored him. Nor could she, though she was no longer certain which category she fell into. Every muscle of his body was familiar to her, every move, every expression. Her feelings were a confused jumble of respect, admiration and longing, which swirled to reach a vortex of pain, sharply remembered. Still, she was caught up in him again. Ty Starbuck demanded every last emotion and didn't really give a damn if it was love or hate.<br><br>Both men moved quickly, their eyes riveted on the small white sphere. Backhand, forehand, drop shot. Sweat poured down unheeded. Both the game and the fans demanded it. A tennis buff wanted to see the effort, the strain, wanted to hear the grunts and whistling breaths, wanted to smell the sweat. Despite her determination to remain dispassionate, Asher found herself watching Ty with the undiluted admiration she'd held for him for more than ten years.<br><br>He played with nonchalant flash&#x2014;contradictory terms, but there it was. Strength, agility, form&#x2014;he had them all. He had a long, limber body, seemingly elastic until the muscles flowed and bunched. His six-two height gave him an advantage of reach, and he could twist and turn on a dime. He played like a fencer&#x2014;Asher had always thought a swashbuckler. Graceful sweeps, lunges, parries, with an almost demonic glint in his dusk-gray eyes. His face was that of the adventurer&#x2014;narrow, rakish, with a hint of strong bone vying with an oddly tender mouth. As always, his hair was a bit too long, flowing wild and black around a white sweatband.<br><br>He was a set-up, and held advantage, but he played as though his life depended on this one point. That hadn't changed, Asher thought, as her heart pounded at double time. She was as involved in the match as if she were the one with the racket in her hand and the sweat rolling over her skin. Her palms were slick, her own muscles tight. Tennis involved its onlookers. Starbuck absorbed them. That hadn't changed either.<br><br>Ty smashed the ball crosscourt at the sideline. It careened away even as the Frenchman dove toward it. Asher sucked in her breath at the speed and placement of the ball.<br><br>"Wide," the line judge said dispassionately. A loud complaint poured out of the crowd. Asher fixed her eyes on Ty and waited for the explosion.<br><br>He stood, breathing hard from the punishing rally, his eyes fixed on the judge. The crowd continued to roar disapproval as deuce was called. Slowly, his eyes still on the judge, Ty swiped his wristband over his brow. His face was inscrutable but for his eyes, and his eyes spoke volumes. The crowd quieted to a murmur of speculation. Asher bit hard on her bottom lip. Ty walked back to the baseline without having uttered a sound.<br><br>This was the change, Asher realized with a jolt. Control. Her breath came out slowly as the tension in her shoulders diminished. In years past, Ty Starbuck would have hurled abuse&#x2014;and an occasional racket&#x2014;snarled, implored the crowd for support or berated them. Now he walked silently across the service court with temper smoldering in his eyes. But he held it in check. This was something new.<br><br>Behind the baseline Ty took his time, took his stance, then cracked an ace, like a bullet from a gun. The crowd screamed for him. With a quiet, insolent patience he waited while the scoring was announced. Again, he held advantage. Knowing him, and others like him, Asher was aware that his mind was occupied with his next move. The ace was already a memory, to be taken out and savored later. He still had a game to win.<br><br>The Frenchman connected with the next serve with a blazing forehand smash. The volley was sweating, furious and blatantly male. It was all speed and fire, two pirates blasting at each other across a sea of hardwood. There was the sound of the ball hitting the heart of the racket, the skid of rubber soles on wood, the grunts of the competitors as they drew out more force, all drowned beneath the echoes of cheers. The crowd was on its feet. Asher was on hers without even being aware of it. Neither man gave quarter as the seconds jumped to a minute, and a minute to more.<br><br>With a swing of the wrist the Frenchman returned a nearly impossible lob that drove him behind the baseline. The ball landed deep in the right court. With a forceful backhand Ty sent the ball low and away from his opponent, ending the two-and-a-half-hour match, three sets to one.<br><br>Starbuck was the U.S. Indoor Tennis champion, and the crowd's hero.<br><br>Asher let the enthusiasm pour around her as Ty walked to the net for the traditional handshake. The match had affected her more than she'd anticipated, but she passed this off as professional admiration. Now she allowed herself to wonder what his reaction would be when he saw her again.<br><br>Had she hurt him? His heart? His pride? The pride, she mused. That she could believe. The heart was a different matter. He would be angry, she concluded. She would be cool. Asher knew how to maintain a cool exterior as well as she knew how to smash an overhead lob. She'd learned it all as a child. When they met, she would simply deploy his temper. She had been preparing for the first encounter almost as religiously as she had been preparing to pick up her profession again. Asher was going to win at both. After he had finished with the showers and the press, she would make it a point to seek him out. To congratulate him&#x2014;and to present the next test. It was much wiser for her to make the first move, for her to be the one prepared. Confident, she watched Ty exchange words with Grimalier at the net.<br><br>Then Ty turned his head very slowly, very deliberately. With no searching through the crowd, no hesitation, his eyes locked on hers. The strength of the contact had her drawing in a sharp, unwilling breath. His eyes held, no wavering. Her mouth went dry. Then he smiled, an unpleasant, direct challenge. Asher met it, more from shock than temerity as the crowd bellowed his name. <i>Starbuck </i>echoed from the walls like a litany. Ten seconds&#x2014;fifteen&#x2014;he neither blinked nor moved. For a man of action he had an uncanny ability for stillness. Boring into hers, his eyes made the distance between them vanish. The smile remained fixed. Just as Asher's palms began to sweat, he turned a full circle for the crowd, his racket above his head like a lance. They adored him.<br><br><i>He'd known, </i>Asher thought furiously as people swarmed around her. He had known all along that she was there. Her anger wasn't the hot, logical result of being outmaneuvered, but small, silver slices of cold fury. Ty had let her know in ten seconds, without words, that the game was still on. And he always won.<br><br>Not this time though, she told herself. She had changed too. But she stood where she was, rooted, staring out at the now empty court. Her thoughts were whirling with memories, emotions, remembered sensations. People brushed by her, already debating the match.<br><br>She was a tall, reed-slim figure tanned gold from hours in the sun. Her hair was short, sculptured and misty-blond. The style flattered, while remaining practical for her profession. Over three years of retirement, Asher hadn't altered it. Her face seemed more suited to the glossy pages of a fashion magazine than the heat and frenzy of a tennis court. A weekender, one might think, looking at her elegant cheekbones in an oval face. Not a pro. The nose was small and straight above a delicately molded mouth she rarely thought to tint. Makeup on the courts was a waste of time, as sweat would wash it away. Her eyes were large and round, a shade of blue that hinted at violet. One of her few concessions to vanity was to darken the thick pale lashes that surrounded them. While other women competitors added jewelry or ribbons and bows to the court dress, Asher had never thought of it. Even off the court her attire leaned toward the simple and muted.<br><br>An enterprising reporter had dubbed her "The Face" when she had been eighteen. She'd been nearly twenty-three when she had retired from professional play, but the name had stuck. Hers was a face of great beauty and rigid control. On court, not a flicker of expression gave her opponent or the crowd a hint of what she was thinking or feeling. One of her greatest defenses in the game was her ability to remain unruffled under stress. The standard seeped into her personal life.<br><br>Asher had lived and breathed tennis for so long that the line of demarcation between woman and athlete was smudged. The hard, unbendable rule, imposed by her father, was ingrained into her&#x2014;privacy, first and last. Only one person had ever been able to cross the boundary. Asher was determined he would not do so again.<br><br>As she stood staring down at the empty court, her face told nothing of her anger or turmoil&#x2014;or the pain she hadn't been prepared for. It was calm and aloof. Her concentration was so deep that the leader of the small packet of people that approached her had to speak her name twice to get her attention.<br><br>She'd been recognized, she discovered. Though Asher had known it was inevitable, it still gave her a twist of pleasure to sign the papers and programs thrust at her. She hadn't been forgotten.<br><br>The questions were easy to parry, even when they skirted close to her relationship with Ty. A smile and double-talk worked well with fans. Asher wasn't na�ve enough to think it would work with reporters. That, she hoped, was for another day.<br><br>As she signed, and edged her way back, Asher spotted a few colleagues&#x2014;an old foe, a former doubles partner, a smattering of faces from the past. Her eyes met Chuck Prince's. Ty's closest friend was an affable player with a wrist of steel and beautiful footwork. Though the silent exchange was brief, even friendly, Asher saw the question in his eyes before she gave her attention to the next fan.<br><br>The word's out, she thought almost grimly as she smiled at a teenage tennis buff. Asher Wolfe's picking up her racket again. And they'd wonder, and eventually ask, if she was picking up Ty Starbuck too.<br><br>"Asher!" Chuck moved to her with the same bouncy stride he used to cross a court. In his typical outgoing style he seized her by the shoulders and kissed her full on the mouth. "Hey, you look terrific!"<br><br>With a laugh Asher drew back the breath his greeting had stolen from her. "So do you." It was inevitably true. Chuck was average in almost every way&#x2014;height, build, coloring. But his inner spark added appeal and a puckish sort of sexuality. He'd never hesitated to exploit it&#x2014;good-naturedly.<br><br>"No one knew you were coming," Chuck complained, easing her gently through the thinning crowd. "I didn't know you were here until..." His voice trailed off so that Asher knew he referred to the ten seconds of potent contact with Ty. "Until after the match," he finished. He gave her shoulder a quick squeeze. "Why didn't you give someone a call?"<br><br>"I wasn't entirely sure I'd make it." Asher allowed herself to be negotiated to a clear spot in a rear hallway. "Then I thought I'd just melt into the crowd. It didn't seem fair to disrupt the match with any the-prodigal-returns business."<br><br>"It was a hell of a match." The flash of teeth gleamed with enthusiasm. "I don't know if I've ever seen Ty play better than he did in the last set. Three aces."<br><br>"He always had a deadly serve," Asher murmured.<br><br>"Have you seen him?"<br><br>From anyone else the blunt question would have earned a cold stare. Chuck earned a quick grimace. "No. I will, of course, but I didn't want to distract him before the match." Asher linked her fingers&#x2014;an old nervous habit. "I didn't realize he knew I was here."<br><br>Distract Starbuck, she thought with an inner laugh. No one and nothing distracted him once he picked up his game racket.<br><br>"He went crazy when you left."<br><br>Chuck's quiet statement brought her back. Deliberately she unlaced her fingers. "I'm sure he recovered quickly." Because the retort was sharper than she had intended, Asher shook her head as if to take back the words. "How have you been? I saw an ad with you touting the virtues of a new line of tennis shoes."<br><br></p><h2>Intoxicating Southern France: Provence &amp; Languedoc Spotlight</h2><p>Pamela "PJ" Adams, whose best seller <b><i>Intoxicating Paris</i></b> uncorks the magic in Paris, is back with another quirky journey.

He spends most of his time basking in the sun and remembering. Chasing rabbits, raising pups with Mrs. Coyote, gathering with his friends on the mountain and howling at the moon &#x2014; it's been a long, full life, and he's grateful for it. But could it be time for him to take one last journey?</p><p>Nancy Wood is an award-winning poet, novelist, photographer, and children's book author. She has been a friend of the Taos Pueblo Indians for more than thirty years. She says that "the idea behind OLD COYOTE comes from a universal belief about the endless circle of life."<br><br>Max Grafe grew up in New Orleans. He now lives in New York City, where he works as a printmaker, painter, and illustrator. He says of OLD COYOTE, "My goal for the images was to capture the essence of the words while leaving enough room for the viewer's imagination to roam." This is Max Grafe's first full-color picture book.Grade 1-3&#x2013;Old Coyote is nearing the end of his days. As he walks familiar paths, he remembers the wide open spaces before the city crept toward his home. He recalls a time when "his howl was so loud that even the earthworms up on the mountain could hear it." He can't run anymore, so he walks, even though his bones ache. He pauses for a rest beneath the old saguaro cactus and continues toward home, greeting Father Sun on his way. Finally, he arrives at his den where he and Mrs. Coyote share some tender moments. With the light from the full moon to guide him, Old Coyote heads out toward a gathering spot where he says good-bye to his animal friends. Climbing slowly to the top of a mountain, he lies down and falls asleep. All the while he is dreaming of golden days gone by, until at last he "[dreams] his way into a whole new world." This gentle and sensitive story is delivered in just the right respectful manner without being maudlin. Grafe's mixed-media illustrations were done in muted shades of brown and blue. The drawings are somewhat impressionistic, mimicking what might be seen by Old Coyote's aging eyes. A comforting tale that is suitable for helping to explain death to young children.<i>&#x2013;Roxanne Burg, Orange County Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Trying to compete with her husband and Droma was too exhausting, and, ultimately, pointless. At times it seemed their affinity wasn&#x2019;t entirely amicable, but it was perfectly natural. They&#x2019;d hardly stopped talking since the Ryn had come aboard. Bringing each other up to date on events since they&#x2019;d parted at Fondor, they covered everything from sneaky tactics to Anakin&#x2019;s death. After the latter, Droma had left the bridge for a while, to sing a plaintive lay in a language Leia didn&#x2019;t understand, but then he&#x2019;d returned with a story about one of his exploits in the Senex sector. The tale was as tall as a Bolenian hillspinner,<br>but it served its purpose by easing the pall of melancholy that had engulfed the <i>Falcon</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;So they started taking apart the tanker module,&#x201d; Han<br>was saying now, relating one of his own stories to Droma,<br>his mood far removed from the grief that had consumed<br>him earlier.<br><br>&#x201c;Which you said was filled with liquid hydrogen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but destroying the tanker didn&#x2019;t stop the hydrogen.<br>If anything, it spread out a little, exactly as<br>planned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Droma asked, frowning. &#x201c;Hydrogen won&#x2019;t<br>burn without oxygen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Goldenrod said. That&#x2019;s the trouble with<br>droids: no imagination. As our shields failed, I told Leia<br>and Jacen to punch holes through the cruiser&#x2019;s hull with<br>our quads. Before I could tell those scarheads to eat ions,<br>there was more than enough oxygen for the hydrogen to<br>react with. The cruiser went up so fast we had a tough<br>time dodging the pieces. After that, it was just a matter of<br>getting out of there. The few skips we left behind weren&#x2019;t<br>putting up much of a fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Understandably. I hear Vong skips are useless once<br>they&#x2019;re cut off from their yammosks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re not completely useless,&#x201d; Han said, &#x201c;but<br>it does give you an advantage.&#x201d;<br><br>Droma shrugged. &#x201c;Speaking of yammosks, I&#x2019;ve heard<br>some stories about them that would make your tail stand<br>on end!&#x201d;<br><br>Leia listened to the banter but offered nothing toward<br>the conversation. Instead, she concentrated on the information<br>Droma had provided them: communications had<br>indeed been lost with the Unknown Regions. The destruction<br>of the base on Generis and the attack on Esfandia appeared<br>to be the source of the disruption. A free-floating<br>proto-world, Esfandia had long since cut free from whatever<br>star had given birth to it, but still had enough radioactivity<br>bubbling in its core to sustain a liquid atmosphere.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t the most hospitable of places, but it didn&#x2019;t need<br>to be. A skeleton crew of about a dozen people, mainly<br>technicians, normally inhabited the relay outpost, which<br>had been hastily converted from a scientific station at<br>the beginning of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. Since<br>Luke&#x2019;s mission had entered the Unknown Regions, the<br>Galactic Alliance&#x2019;s military presence around Esfandia had<br>been upgraded to two squadrons of X-wings and a frigate<br>by the name of <i>Corellian Way</i>. What had happened to<br>those forces was unknown. The relay staff only had time<br>to broadcast a message alerting their superiors on Mon<br>Calamari that they were under attack by the Yuuzhan<br>Vong before all communications had been lost.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a sure sign of disaster. The<br>relay base was designed to resist such attacks. Imperial<br>AT-AT technology had been adapted to the cold soup of<br>Esfandia&#x2019;s environment, creating a giant, mechanical, crablike<br>construction capable of moving from place to place<br>at a slow but steady pace. Such mobility was an advantage,<br>given that most of the world was studded with<br>receivers sensitive enough to detect transmissions from<br>deep in the Unknown Regions. The base was designed to<br>circumnavigate the globe, maintaining the receivers, while<br>the technicians remained safely inside. That the ability to<br>move made it easier to hide when attacked was a bonus.<br><br>The base, therefore, could have simply gone to ground,<br>tucked away in a crevasse or under the thick silt of the atmospheric<br>soup. If it could be found, it could be reactivated.<br>Assuming, of course, that the Yuuzhan Vong hadn&#x2019;t<br>found it first and destroyed it for good.<br><br>Leia sent her thoughts outward, far beyond her location<br>in hyperspace, beyond Esfandia and whatever awaited<br>them there, to her brother, Luke. The last message Cal<br>Omas had received from him suggested he&#x2019;d found a<br>promising lead and was setting off to investigate. He<br>hadn&#x2019;t specified what that lead consisted of or where he<br>was headed, and now there was no way they would know<br>unless they repaired the communications outage. Leia<br>had no doubt that, were anything terrible to happen to<br>him, then she would know about it. She would <i>feel </i>it,<br>just as she had in the past. Nevertheless, she was concerned.<br>So much was invested in his mission&#x2014;personally,<br>and on a galactic scale&#x2014;that if something were to go<br>wrong, it would be a disaster of unimaginable proportions.<br><br>The conversation between her husband and his old<br>friend shifted as the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s console began to beep and<br>flash, announcing that they were nearing their destination.<br><br>&#x201c;Right on the nose,&#x201d; Han said proudly, flipping switches<br>in readiness for the return to realspace.<br><br>&#x201c;And we didn&#x2019;t even have to get out and push,&#x201d;<br>Droma said dryly.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s real amusing,&#x201d; Han returned without<br>smiling. &#x201c;Now you want to move your funny, fuzzedup<br>self out of that chair so Leia can come forward and<br>help me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s all right, Han,&#x201d; she said as Droma began<br>to stand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Droma can manage.&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t say that she was enjoying the break from<br>routine, but it was interesting to watch Han&#x2019;s interaction<br>with the Ryn. Memories of the terrible time when Han<br>had pulled away from her while grieving for Chewbacca<br>still stung, but only Droma had witnessed how low Han<br>had really sunk back then. If having the Ryn aboard did<br>remind Han of those painful times, he certainly wasn&#x2019;t<br>letting it show.<br><br>&#x201c;You remember how to operate the copilot&#x2019;s board?&#x201d;<br><br>Han asked Droma without looking up from what he was<br>doing.<br><br>&#x201c;Follow orders, and curse when something goes<br>wrong,&#x201d; Droma replied with a smile. &#x201c;Which it invariably<br>does.&#x201d;<br><br>Han affected an indignant expression on behalf of his<br>beloved freighter. &#x201c;Hey, she may be old&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But she&#x2019;s still got it where it counts, right?&#x201d; Droma<br>said.<br><br>&#x201c;What have I told you about doing that?&#x201d; Han said<br>irritably.<br><br>Droma laughed. &#x201c;Anyway, it&#x2019;s not the age of the ship<br>that worries me,&#x201d; he said, flicking a couple of switches of<br>his own. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the age of the pilot I&#x2019;m more concerned<br>about.&#x201d;<br><br>The navicomputer bleeped, cutting off any retort Han<br>might have been about to offer. Both faced the front just<br>as the sweeping streaks of hyperspace dissolved into a<br>cold and distant starscape. There was no primary to dim<br>the stars with its glare; the nearest inhabited system in<br>this section of the Mid Rim was more than ten light years<br>away, and the nearest star of any kind was half that<br>distance. There was nothing for trillions of kilometers<br>but space dust, and the tiny bauble that was the lonely<br>world of Esfandia.<br><br>Or so it <i>should </i>have been. As <i>Pride of Selonia </i>along<br>with Twin Suns Squadron emerged from hyperspace alongside<br>the <i>Falcon</i>, Droma&#x2019;s eyes checked the sensor console<br>for the orphaned planet. The <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s sensor suite was<br>still ahead of standard tech, and it soon acquired the target.<br>It was covered with thick clouds, and glowed a burnt<br>orange in artificial colors that looked wrong to Leia&#x2019;s<br>eyes until she realized what was missing: because Esfandia<br>had no sun, its sole source of heat lay at its core. And<br>with no orbit to follow, that meant it would have no seasons,<br>either&#x2014;which in turn meant no icy poles, and no<br>broiling equator. It would be the same temperature all<br>over.<br><br>Closer scans, however, revealed that not to be entirely<br>the case. There were at least six hot spots on the hemisphere<br>facing them, and even as they watched, another<br>blossomed into life.<br><br>Droma zoomed in closer to examine the cause.<br><br>&#x201c;Aerial bombardment,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s dropping<br>mines from orbit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re taking out the sensors,&#x201d; Leia said. &#x201c;The Yuuzhan<br>Vong are still here!&#x201d;<br><br>Han&#x2019;s eyes darted across the displays in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a strong presence in close orbit. Seven capital<br>vessels, nine cruisers. Not many skips detached, though.<br>No sign of the local defenses, or the reinforcements from<br>Mon Cal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I can guess why not, too,&#x201d; Droma commented.<br><br>Leia knew exactly what he meant. The Yuuzhan Vong<br>force in orbit over Esfandia was enormous by any standard.<br>Against the two squadrons and one frigate Esfandia<br>had possessed, plus the two squadrons Mon Calamari<br>had dispatched to investigate, it was almost obscene.<br><i>Overkill </i>didn&#x2019;t cover it.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought the Vong&#x2019;s resources were stretched,&#x201d; Droma<br>said.<br><br>Han just grunted. A crackle of information flowed<br>across newly reopened communications lines. Captain<br>Mayn and Jag were looking for instructions.<br><br>&#x8;...</p><h2>Birth and Sex: The Power and the Passion</h2><p>Sex and birth are often talked about as contrasting experiences. In fact, when birth is physiological, not medical or surgical, and a woman is free to be spontaneous, endorphins surge into her blood stream in the same way as during sexual excitement. Sheila Kitzinger discusses sex during and after pregnancy, during motherhood and the sexuality of birth.</p><p>Sheila Kitzinger M.B.E is a social anthropologist of birth and author of 24 books published internationally and lives near Oxford, England.

But Navajo Tribal policeman Jim Chee and his mentor, Joe Leaphorn, discover an even deadlier killer stalking the reservation in the most chilling and beautifully crafted novel yet from the beloved and bestselling master of Southwestern suspense. <p> When Acting Lt. Chee catches a Hopi eagle poacher literally red-handed--huddled over the bloody body of a young Navajo Tribal police officer--he has an open-and-shut case. Even the Feds--usually at odds with Chee--agree, and it seems the Hopi is headed for the gas chamber. Until Joe Leaphorn shows up to blowChee's case wide open. </p><p> Leaphorn, now retired form the Navajo Tribal Police, has been hired to find Cathy Pollard, a hot-headed biologist who disappeared from the same remote area on the same day the Navajo cop was murdered. Is she a suspect? A victim? And what are Chee and Leaphorn to make of the report that a skinwalker--a Navajo witch--was seen in the same area at the same time? </p><p> To answer these questions, Leaphorn and Chee must immerse themselves in the enigmatic web of scientists hunting the key to the most virulent form of bubonic plague since the Middle Ages. </p><p> In addition to its finely wrought plot, <i>The First Eagle</i> offers a wealth of Tony Hillerman's signature gifts--glorious evocations of the high desert, delicately drawn characters, and eloquent insights into the foibles and wisdom of the Southwest's native people.</p></p><p>It seems like July 8 is going to be a bad day for Acting Lieutenant Jim Chee. He's got a stack of overdue paperwork on his desk. Anderson Nez has died of plague, but the circumstances around the death are murky. His ex-fianc�e, Janet Pete, is returning from Washington, D.C., and Chee doesn't know what to think about her last letter. (Will they be getting married this time?) And Officer Benny Kinsman's unwanted advances have enraged Catherine Pollard (among others), one of the scientists studying this newest outbreak of the black death. Now, the hot-headed Kinsman's gone off to nab a Hopi man who's poaching eagles. When Chee is called to back Kinsman up at Yells Back Butte, the bad day turns worse. He finds the young Hopi, Robert Jano, standing over Benny's mortally wounded body. Jano insists that he did not kill the police officer. Add to all this Joe Leaphorn's separate investigation, also involving July 8. Joe's got a new role as consulting detective to the wealthy--investigating the July 8 disappearance at Yells Back Butte of the same Catherine Pollard who was dogged by Kinsman. <p> This one bad day and the ensuing days of investigation bring Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee together once again as they uncover the secret of Yells Back Butte, plague fleas, and skinwalkers. As usual, Hilllerman's ear for dialogue is remarkable. One does not read Leaphorn and Chee's words and thoughts as much as hear them. While the book invites new readers (little knowledge of the previous books in the series is presumed), one has the sense of entering an old neighborhood where friends and relations are established and emotions run deep. Jim Chee's pain is vivid as he struggles under the shadow of Leaphorn and questions the "rusty trailer" lifestyle that has driven him apart from Janet. Nothing is contrived in his mixture of fear and elation when he and Janet meet again. </p><p> Hillerman has written an engaging novel that once again evokes the land and people of the Southwest while also confronting the cultural separateness of the region from the power centers of the East. Already honored for his previous work (<i>Dance Hall of the Dead</i> received the Edgar), <i>The First Eagle</i> is a welcome addition to the beloved Chee-Leaphorn series that began in 1971 with <i>The Blessing Way</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Tony Hillerman (1925&#x2013;2008), an Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident since 1963, was the author of 29 books, including the popular 18-book mystery series featuring Navajo police officers Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, two non-series novels, two children&#x2019;s books, and nonfiction works.

She spent the early part of her life at Brindabella, the family home station in the Monaro region of NSW. After the publication of My Brilliant Career in 1901, Franklin trained as a nurse and worked as a housemaid in both Sydney and Melbourne. She also wrote as a freelance journalist for the Daily Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Her protagonists in these eight linked stories are Josephine (Billy) Delielle and Francis Clemens, both intelligent achievers happily married to their respective spouses, who fall into an unlikely but tender affair when they meet in the offices of the highbrow journal to which they both contribute articles on economics. Billy is young, sloppy, often grumpy, unsentimental, determinedly minimalist in her tastes in food and clothing. Francis is older, sophisticated, urbane, committed to neatness and routine. The stories depict some of the same events told from their differing points of view; despite passion and familiarity, each discovers the essential unknowableness of the other. Both know the relationship will have to end, but the ache of parting is ameliorated for Billy by the consolidation of her marriage through the birth of a baby. Billy and Francis are somewhat improbable as lovers, and Colwin studs the text with too many pithy apothegms about the indelible effects of a love affair, but there are many moments in this slim volume when the reader is touched and moved.

She has also written numerous articles for newspapers and magazines. A long-time resident of Kennebunk, Maine, she has been Town Historian since 1990.If it wasn&#x2019;t true, Wildfire Loose: The Week Maine Burned would make a good science fiction tale. I knew that Bar Harbor and Mt. Desert Island burned badly in 1947, but I did not know the devastating fires spread throughout the state, terrorizing Mainers, exhausting fire fighters, wiping out entire communities.<br>Glad I wasn&#x2019;t born until 1948!<br>A severe drought set the stage for this tragedy, which was ignited, in many places, by carelessly tossed cigarettes. Some of the fires were deliberately set. But it only took a single spark to set the ground ablaze.<br>From the New Hampshire border to Washington County, Moosehead Lake to Harpswell, and even in the city of Portland, fires raged out of control. &#x201c;In 35 communities,&#x201d; reports author Joyce Butler, &#x201c;109 houses had been damaged, and 851 permanent homes, 397 summer homes, and an undetermined number of barns and garages had been destroyed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Millions of trees were killed, millions severely burned.&#x201d; In York County, more than 131,000 acres, &#x201c;80 percent of it woodland, were black.&#x201d; More than 200,000 acres statewide burned. And three million feet of cut lumber was destroyed.<br>But it was the homes, farms, and businesses destroyed by these raging fires that were the most devastating losses. Everything their owners possessed, including pets, was lost. Butler excels in telling their individual stories.<br>In this single October week, &#x201c;nine communities had been practically wiped out, four more had suffered severe damage, and scores of others had lost buildings. Property damage was estimated at $30 million. Fifteen had died... In many sections the earth itself had been consumed. Maine had become an armed camp, her roads patrolled by the National Guard, Legionnaires, the police, and self-appointed vigilantes.&#x201d;<br>Regular folks &#x2013; including lots of high school and college students &#x2013; mustered out all over the state to help fight the fires.<br><br>It was particularly painful to read the accounts of Maine farmers who lost everything. Here&#x2019;s one.<br>&#x201c;At his farm on the hill above Route 5 (in Dayton), Roy Meserve watched until the sky began to show red over the edge of a hill about a half mile away. Then he ran to the stable for a tool kit he wanted to save and then to the barn to loose his horses and cattle. He had turned out twenty of the cows, most of them his nephew&#x2019;s, when he heard someone shout form the barnyard.<br>&#x201c;He ran to the door and had to drop to his hands and knees and crawl to safety. The barn was on fire. The sky was raining sparks. The animals he had not had time to loosen died in the flames, the flesh burned away from their bones. His house &#x2013; everything he had worked for all his life &#x2013; was gone.&#x201d;<br>Many domestic animals died in the fires. And while lots of wild animals were able to flee the fire, many were killed. Rabbits ran down the roads with their fur on fire, described by firefighters as &#x201c;little balls of flame rolling along the ground.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The morning after Lyman was swept by fire,&#x201d; writes Butler, &#x201c;Route 111 was strewn with rabbits and other small animals, dead of asphyxiation... Dead trout were found in a North Kennebunkport brook... firefighters saw confused grouse flying into the fire.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wardens found deer suffocated in fields where they had taken refuge. One deer, evidently fleeing the fire, running and leaping through the smoky woods, had impaled himself on a snag.&#x201d;<br>And even the critters that escaped, &#x201c;faced starvation in the long winter ahead for the fire hard destroyed their natural feed and cover. When hunting was allowed in November in order to lower the deer population, hunters found many of the deer they killed had severely burned feet.&#x201d;<br>Five hundred members of fish and game and rod and gun clubs spent the first weekend of November looking for animals &#x2013; dead or alive &#x2013; in the fields and forests of York County.<br>There are many heroes in this book. Some are pictured in a collection of photos in the center of the book.<br>Joyce Butler has written eight books, including a two-volume history of the Kennebunks, curated several exhibits at the Center for Maine Histories, and lectured widely.<br>Wildfire Loose was originally published in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the great fires of 1947, and reissued in 2014 by Down East Books, which also published the original. We are fortunate that Butler was able to interview some of the folks who were impacted by the fire. Their accounts are astonishing, and in many cases, heartbreaking. Butler said she didn&#x2019;t want us to ever forget this fire.<br>If you read this book, you certainly won&#x2019;t.<br>&#x2014;George Smith, Bangor Daily News<br><br>In October 1947, Maine experienced the worst fire disaster in its history. Climaxing months of drought, fires raged across more than 200,000 acres. Nine communities were practically leveled and four others severely damaged. Fifteen people lost their lives. Wildfire Loose describes how the fires started and spread so quickly through rural villages, down Millionaire&#x2019;s Row in Bar Harbor, and across southern Maine beach resorts. Originally published in 1979, it remains the definitive account of &#x201c;The Week Maine Burned.&#x201d;</p><h2>Full Disclosure</h2><p>She was already well-known in some circles before March 6, 2018, but that&#39;s probably the first time you heard the name Stormy Daniels. That&#39;s the day she filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over a nondisclosure agreement negotiated before the election but never signed. How did Stormy Daniels become the woman willing to take on a president? What is it like to be reviled by some, held up as a beacon of hope by others, and to be an object of fascination to all? In this book, Stormy Daniels tells her whole story for the first time: about how she came to be a leading actress and director in the adult film business, the full truth about her journey from a rough childhood in Louisiana onto the national stage, and everything about the events that led to the nondisclosure agreement and the behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate her. Stormy is funny, sharp, warm, and impassioned by turns. Her story is a thoroughly American one, of a girl who loved reading and horses and who understood from a very young age what she wanted_and who also knew she&#39;d have to get every step of the way there on her own. People can&#39;t stop talking about Stormy Daniels. And they won&#39;t be able to stop talking about her fresh, surprising, completely candid, nothing-held-back book.</p><p></p><h2>Rhythms of Modern Life: British Prints, 1914-1939</h2><p>Discuss the impact of the European Avant-garde, especially Cubism and Futurism on British art from the outbreak of World War I to the commencement of World War II.

(Steven Heller <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Otto Kahn: Art, Money, and Modern Time</h2><p>In the early decades of the twentieth century, almost everyone in modern theater, literature, or film knew of Otto Kahn (1867-1934), and those who read the financial press or followed the news from Wall Street could scarcely have missed his name. A partner at one of America's premier private banks, he played a leading role in reorganizing the U.S. railroad system and supporting the Allied war effort in World War I. The German-Jewish Kahn was also perhaps the most influential patron of the arts the nation has ever seen: he helped finance the Metropolitan Opera, brought the Ballets Russes to America, and bankrolled such promising young talent as poet Hart Crane, the Provincetown Players, and the editors of the <i>Little Review</i>. <br><br>This book is the full-scale biography Kahn has long deserved. Theresa Collins chronicles Kahn's life and times and reveals his singular place at the intersection of capitalism and modernity.

Little Mouse watches and learns until, when Old Chen can no longer make the lanterns, he finds his inner strength and his hidden talent.

The traditions of a culture and the magic of an art form are carefully preserved as they are passed from one generation to the next.<br><br>Exquisite, bright illustrations, as delicately rendered as the Chinese paper lanterns themselves, draw readers of all ages into this simple story of the power of friendship, patience, and perseverance.</p><p>Stefan Czernecki is an author and illustrator of children&#39;s books.

Visit him online at www.stefanczernecki.com.<p>K-Gr 2-Old Chen is getting tired of crafting the beautiful paper lanterns he has perfected, but there is no one to carry on the tradition-until a boy shows up, full of awe. Old Chen gives Little Mouse chores to do around the shop. The child carefully observes the master at work, and practices in secret at home. One day, he presents his creation to Chen, and the master knows he has finally found an apprentice worthy of his craft. When the big lantern festival comes, Old Chen is too weak to create the dragon masterpiece he has planned, and Little Mouse finishes it, making his teacher proud. While the bright, bold illustrations of the lanterns are lovely to look at, the artist's depiction of the characters is less successful. The round faces, quarter-moon-shaped eyes, prominent top row of teeth, angular wisps of hair, and nerdy buttoned-up shirt style are offensively stereotypical. According to the book jacket, this story is set in modern times, but the representations of the Asian faces are old-fashioned. The artist/author's stylized illustrations in The Cricket's Cage (Hyperion, 1997) are far better.

The fun of these books is in the ten child-like pig siblings who live in a world of human accouterments, a world that is populated only by pigs and the occasional Wolf. These stories involve the pigs using reverse psychology on a contrary Benjamin Pig, Mr. and Mrs. Pig's attempt to sleep after all ten children squeeze into their bed, and a sports day full of events that pit the boys against the girls. The best are a story in which Garth Pig's siblings save him from Mrs. Wolf, who has crashed their parents' party, and a hilarious one in which Benjamin and Alun try to help with the gardening. Rayner's expressive watercolors on an open white background are appealing and reveal the character of the porcine protagonists.

Designed to to create and use ingredients that maximize flavor, these 400 recipes are derived from 40 common ingredients--from asparagus to fish to zucchini--used at each stage of its "life cycle": fresh, preserved, and in a main dish.</b><br><br>Seasoned cooks know that the secret to great meals is this: the more you cook, the less you actually have to do to produce a delicious meal. The trick is to approach cooking as a continuum, where each meal draws on elements from a previous one and provides the building blocks for another. That synchronicity is a kitchen ecosystem. <br><br> For the farmers market regular as well as a bulk shopper, for everyday home cooks and aspirational ones, a kitchen ecosystem starts with cooking the freshest in-season ingredients available, preserving some to use in future recipes, and harnessing leftover components for other dishes. In The Kitchen Ecosystem, Eugenia Bone spins multiple dishes from single ingredients: homemade ricotta stars in a pasta dish while the leftover whey is used to braise pork loin; marinated peppers are tossed with shrimp one night and another evening chicken thighs and breast simmer in that leftover marinade. The bones left from a roast chicken bear just enough stock to make stracciatella for two.&nbsp; The small steps in creating &#x201c;supporting ingredients&#x201d; actually <i>saves</i> time when it comes to putting together dinner.<br><br> Delicious food is not only a matter exceptional recipes&#x2014;although there are an abundance of those here. Rather, it is a matter of approaching the kitchen as a system of connected foods. The Kitchen Ecosystem changes the paradigm of how we cook, and in doing so, &nbsp;it may change everything about the way we eat today.</p><p>Eugenia Bone&#x2019;s writing has<b> </b>appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Denver Post</i>, <i>Saveur</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, and <i>The National Lampoon</i>, among other publications.&nbsp; She is the author of Mycophilia, hailed by <i>The New York Times</i> as &#x201c;A delicious, suprising and dizzyingly informative book&#x201d; and of Well-Preserved: Recipes and Techniques for Putting up Small Batches of Seasonal Food.&nbsp; She lives in New York City and Colorado. <b>&nbsp;</b>&#x201c;[<i>The Kitchen Ecosystem</i>] will turn you into a smarter cook. The idea is to get the most out of seasonal ingredients by cooking some fresh, preserving some, and using the scraps. This way, the kitchen becomes an ecosystem with a continuous cycle of use and less waste...Her Ecosystem ideas are likely to spark waves of creativity in the home cook. It&#x2019;s a great starting point for anyone looking to cook more thoughtfully, and economically.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Cherry Bombe</i> </b><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s built around a genius stratagem that each meal you cook can yield not just that night&#x2019;s dinner but more: an essential pantry item, an element for the next meal, and the next.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;James Oseland<br><br></b>&#x201c;One of the things I love most about&nbsp;<i>The Kitchen Ecosystem</i>&nbsp;is that Bone takes methods and techniques we all know we&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be using, and breaks them down into manageable chapters sorted by ingredient&#x2014;apricots, beef, corn, and so forth.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>5280 The Denver Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>The Kitchen Ecosystem</i> is] an efficient means of enjoying fresh foods at their seasonal peak, prudently preserving some foods for later, and transforming kitchen scraps, like peels and bones, into flavor builders.<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>The Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><h2>The Woman Who Walked in Sunshine: No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency (16) (No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency Series)</h2><p><b>This latest installment of Alexander McCall Smith's bestselling No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series...as endearing and delectable as ever!<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precious Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi are both back in harness at the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, but for once business is a bit slow. At Mma Makutsi's suggestion, Mma Ramotswe allows herself to be persuaded to take a holiday--her first ever!--even if she finds it a bit odd that Mma Makusti should be so adamant about it. But just as Mma Ramotswe is ready to depart, a new client arrives, a young woman whose father was regarded as a hero in the history of Botswana. Now his reputation is being called into question--was he courageous, as is widely believed, or was he merely a philanderer and opportunist? Though Mma Ramotswe initially wants to cancel her trip, she is cajoled into going by Mma Makutsi's assurances that she and Charlie have the situation well in hand. However Mma Ramotswe finds that she cannot possibly submit to the luxuries of a carefree holiday without knowing exactly what's going on at the Agency, so she asks Charlie to be her eyes and ears while she's away--failing to account for the fact that Charlie is not an altogether reliable emissary, particularly with much of his attention diverted to the challenges of a newly adopted dog. At the close of the investigation, everyone at the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency will confront some uncomfortable truths from their own past and learn to treat certain ordinary human failings with a large helping of charity and compassion.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH</b> is the author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series and the 44 Scotland Street series.

Nearly a hundred years later, Justin, born and raised in New Jersey, knows little of his family beyond the Garden State. </p><p>That changes in 2001 when he discovers that his grandfather's cousin, Padre Gaetano Catanoso, is a Vatican-certified miracle worker. After a life of serving the poor and founding an order of nuns, Gaetano had been approved by Pope John Paul II to become a saint, the first priest from Calabria ever to be canonized. A typically lapsed American Catholic, Justin embarks on a quest to connect with his extended family in southern Italy and, ultimately, to awaken his slumbering faith. </p><p><em>My Cousin the Saint</em> charts the parallel history of two relatives&#x2014;Justin's grandfather, Carmelo, and his sainted cousin, Gaetano. While Carmelo leaves his homeland to pursue New World prosperity, Gaetano stays behind to relieve Old World misery. Justin reunites the two halves of a sundered family by both exploring the life of the saint in Calabria and uncovering the untold story of his grandfather's family, raised in New Jersey between two world wars. </p><p>Justin confronts his own tenuous spiritual moorings in the process. After meeting with Vatican officials in Rome, he is astonished by the complexity of saint-making. After hearing one miracle story after another, he struggles with the line between the mystical and the divine. After seeing his brother fall ill with terminal cancer, he questions the value of prayer. And after reveling in the charm and generosity of his newfound Italian relatives, he comes to learn what it means to have a saint in the family.</p><p>A compelling narrative written with grace and honesty, <em>My Cousin the Saint</em> is a testament to the challenge of being Catholic in twenty-first-century America. More than a biography, more than an immigrant memoir, more than a chronicle of renewed faith, it is a love letter to a family now reunited across oceans and years.</p></p><p><p>Justin Catanoso is a journalist who also teaches writing and editing at Wake Forest University. Since 1998, he has served as the executive editor of <em>The Business Journal</em>, based in Greensboro, North Carolina. A Pulitzer Prize nominee, he has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and <em>Business Week</em>, and appeared on National Public Radio.

Brewing in New England goes back four centuries, beginning with the Pilgrims who dropped anchor in Plymouth because their supply of beer was running low. (After barely surviving the winter, they planted a crop of barley and soon brewed their first ale.) Making beer in New England hasn't always been easy. Puritan housewives, industrial era beer moguls, and contemporary craft brewers alike have concocted humankind's oldest beverage in the face of scarce ingredients, legal hurdles, and public indifference. But despite these challenges, beer continues to be a staple of New England life.<br>With <i>Crafty Bastards: Beer in New England from the Mayflower to Modern Day</i>, Lauren Clark deepens our appreciation for the perfect pint. Giving voice to the inimitable Yankee spirit that allows New Englanders to faithfully produce some of the best beers in the nation, Clark invites readers to take a giant swig of brewing past and present.</p><p>Lauren Clarke is a journalist and a former bartender and brewer. Her articles have appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>Jane</i>, and <i>Yankee Magazine</i>.

Throughout the 199 pages of 'Crafty Bastards,' the nation's constant legislative and moral complex for and against intoxication is comedically portrayed." <b>- <i>Shaun Kirby, RICentral.com</i></b><br> <br><br> "Lauren Clark has written a charming history of New England 'suds' ...&nbsp;I love Clark's playful pokes at the tug-of-war between beer as the moderate alternative to 'demon rum', and the colonial illustrations of excessive drinkers sobering up in the stocks. The book starts early and runs till this very moment with fun profiles of some of the crafty bastards currently re-inventing the perfect pint in today's not-so-sober New England." <b><i>-Louisa Kasdon, Edible Boston</i></b><br> <br><br>Lauren Clark puts four hundred years of beer making in New England into focus with splashes of success and uncanny failures, religious zealots and craft beer pioneers. Almost every American brewing trend travelled through New England first and it s all here. This is the rocky story of our brewing culture. <br><i><b>-Dann Paquette, Pretty Things Beer and Ale Project</b></i><br><br>Lauren Clark takes readers on a supremely sudsy tour of New England ales, lagers, pilsners, and porters.

She was the only female leader of an Anglo-Saxon kingdom. It is the tale of one family, two kingdoms and a common enemy. Born into the royal house of Wessex at the height of the Viking wars, she is sent to her aunt in Mercia as a foster-child, only to return home when the Vikings overrun Mercia. In Wessex, she witnesses another Viking attack and this compounds her fear of the enemy. She falls in love with a Mercian lord but is heartbroken to be given as bride to the ruler of Mercia to seal the alliance between the two Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. She must learn to subjugate her feelings for her first love, overcome her indifference to her husband and win the hearts of the Mercians who despise her as a foreigner, twice making an attempt on her life. When her husband falls ill and is incapacitated, she has to learn to rule and lead an army in his stead and when he subsequently dies, she must fight to save her adopted Mercia from the Vikings and, ultimately, her own brother.</p><p></p><h2>The Wisdom of the Middle Ages</h2><p>This engaging survey of important works from late antiquity to the beginning of the Renaissance reveals the depth of thought and the diversity of expression that characterized the Middle Ages. Michael Kellogg demonstrates that medieval thought owes far more to ancient philosophy than is generally supposed; that poets of this era were as sophisticated and nuanced as their ancient counterparts; and that writers of this time anticipated most of the lines of inquiry that gave rise to the Renaissance. The author examines philosophical treatises, memoirs, letters, tales, romances, and epics, documenting the unique array of evolving concerns that drove the medieval search for wisdom. Among the authors and works discussed are Augustine&#39;s Confessions; Boethius&#39;s Consolation of Philosophy; Beowulf; the writings of Abelard and Heloise, Francis of Assisi, and Thomas Aquinas; the Song of Roland; the Arthurian romances of Chretien de Troyes; Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy; and the tales of Boccaccio and Chaucer.Written for the lay reader, this lively overview of a flourishing era, often devalued in our time as a benighted period of history, will bring a new appreciation to the many accomplishments of the Middle Ages.</p><p><b>Michael K.

The intertwining of history with the analysis of literary and philosophical/theological works crisscrosses modern disciplinary boundaries, illuminating the so-called Dark Ages for all readers. Kellogg's sensitive and informed readings serve those who are new to these important works and provide valuable insights to those for whom they are old friends.&#x201d;&#x2015;Eileen C. Sweeney, professor of philosophy, Boston College, and author of Anselm of Canterbury and the Desire for the Word&#x201c;With grace and confidence, Kellogg&nbsp;takes the reader on a journey through some of the best literature and philosophical writings of the Middle Ages. Kellogg makes a firm argument that this period in European history should be seen as an era in which human aspiration, achievement, and curiosity flourished. His sensitive and scholarly readings of writers from Augustine to Chaucer make his case in an accessible and convincing way. What is particularly impressive about The Wisdom of the Middle Ages is Kellogg's ability to convey the complex ideas of writers in the Middle Ages in thoughtful and clear prose. This engaging book will surely inspire readers to discover the original texts for themselves.&#x201d;&#x2015;Emily A.

There are many histories of philosophy and histories of science, but they are too narrow. Who has the learning, insight, writing skill, and breadth to encompass so huge a topic as the ideas that define an age? For the previous generation, the standard was set by John Herman Randall Jr. Randall's successor in our day is Michael K. Kellogg. His The Wisdom of the Middle Ages is engaging, incisive, authoritative, and amazingly comprehensive. Whether you are looking for the ideal text for a course, or just a great read, this book is enthusiastically recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;Keith M.

Colonial Churches of Virginia charts the histories of these early church buildings and their significance in the growth of the Commonwealth and the founding of this nation. <p>Although stately in appearance, these churches have endured the same struggles as the colonists who built them. Their walls have survived&#x2014;sometimes just barely&#x2014;the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, as well as a few Indian battles. Some were used as hospitals, schools, and memorials, their pulpits and pews turned into fuel to keep soldiers warm. One church found an English cannon ball buried in its brick side. In another churchyard, a statue of King George III was melted down to supply bullets for the patriots. </p><p>Included in the collection are some of the most neglected, as well as the most famous churches in the state. The book examines in detail colonial architecture, various legends and war stories, and famous parishioners such as John Smith, George Washing-ton, and Patrick Henry, along with those buried in the yards&#x2014;and sometimes under the floors&#x2014;of the churches. Each entry features photographs, directions to the church, and times of services. The book also includes a complete listing of the colonial clergy in Virginia. </p><p>Although the historic importance of these churches is evident, what remains most intriguing, and perhaps most elusive, is the essence behind the construction. Each church&#x2019;s story reveals the common hope that inspired the parishioners. It was the expectation that this new world would be a place of free worship, a community for their descendants to prosper, and ultimately, a land they could call home. Colonial Churches of Virginia connects us to this period of adventure and allows us to experience the same pioneering spirit.</p></p><p>The late Don W. Massey was born in Durham, North Carolina.

Originally asked by National Public Radio to write an original story with a Christmas theme, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Wicked </i>and <i>A Lion Among Men</i> was once again inspired by the fairy tales we all loved in childhood&#x2014;and he composed a poignant and enchanting tale of transcendence.

Maguire&#x2032;s new piece, entitled "Matchless," reilluminates Andersen&#x2032;s classic, using his storytelling magic to rekindle Andersen&#x2032;s original intentions, and to suggest transcendence, the permanence of spirit, and the continuity that links the living and the dead.</p><p>Gregory Maguire is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>; <em>Lost</em>; <em>Mirror Mirror</em>; and the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and <em>Out of Oz</em>.

She has written three books, Eyewitness on Alcatraz being the first one. She also wrote Bridman, The Many Faces of Robert Stroud, a biography, and Breaking the Rock, The Great Escape from Alcatraz.As a child of seven, Babyak went to live on "The Rock" in the 1950s. Her father, Arthur Dollison, was office manager of the prison's industries and later associate warden. Through interviews with former employees and their families, Babyak compiles a series of inside reminiscences that excludes readers. Dull and gray, like imagined prison walls, the prose is replete with restrictions ("Women and children were forbidden on the shoreline during daylight hours while prisoners were out of their cells. Families were not permitted dogs or cats") and with ordinary events like fishing (when the water on the west side of the island teemed with bass and "you could not get your line back without a fish on it"). Perhaps Babyak describes the crux of her book's problem when she admits, "Seemingly ordinary concerns took on exaggerated meaning on an island prison," or when she explains that "because our fathers felt that few outsiders understood their problems, prison people often remained insulated. Vacations in our household tended to include tours to other prisons . . . " She provides sparse, dry reports on escapes and attempted escapes, hints vaguely at complex prisoner-guard relationships and repeatedly fails to delve into potentially fascinating material.

But other villagers think that growing rice is a more practical use for the land. &#34;This is a beautiful book with many layers of meaning and an important message. The simple illustrations...are lovely and appealing.&#34;--School Library Journal.</p><p><p>Holly Keller has illustrated a number of books in the Lets-Read-and-Find-Out Science series, including <em>Be a Friend to Trees</em>. She is also the author and illustrator of many picture books, including <em>Island Baby</em> and <em>Horace</em>.</p><p>Ms. Keller lives in West Redding, Connecticut.</p>Ages 5-8. Sarus cranes, long regarded as good luck, have disappeared from the Mekong Delta after canals drained the land during the Vietnam War. Now young Nam's village has an opportunity to lure the cranes back by building dikes to restore the wetlands feeding ground. The villagers are divided along generational lines. Nam's mother argues that drained fields are more useful for growing rice. But Grandfather values tradition and believes the cranes are entitled to their original home. The experiment is allowed a year's trial. During the following dry season, Nam's dogs retrieve two baby birds, and when he and Papa visit the feeding ground, they discover the birds have indeed returned. Grandfather happily joins other Tam Nong villagers as they admire the beautiful flock in flight. But he cautions Nam that it is "up to you" whether the birds will stay. Keller's argument for wildlife restoration springs from her involvement in project "Saving Cranes in Vietnam." Understandably, she gives little attention to arguments in favor of retaining land for farming. Clear ink and watercolor illustrations capture the stilt village and surrounding terrain well. However, only a small section of dike, which is critical to the villagers' strategy, is depicted in a single frame. This volume will be useful in geography curricula and in exploring war's consequences, as well as in environmental studies. <i>Elizabeth Bush</i></p><h2>Antiquities to Impressionism: The William A.

Defending the vigor of jazz, blues, country, gospel, and early rock&#39;n&#39;roll, Bayles argues that recent styles like grunge, punk, and gangsta rap have succumbed to a mindless cult of shock and sonic abuse.Bayles, former TV and arts columnist for the Wall Street Journal , takes the title for her book from the old saying, "If you don't like the blues, you've got a hole in your soul." The author of this wide-ranging study of American popular music maintains that the African American tradition--blues, jazz, gospel--is this country's "distinctive musical idiom . . . truer to civilized values" than punk, heavy metal, rap and other antisocial impulses descended from the late-19th century European avant-garde trends in art that led to futurism, surrealism, dada and ultimately to music whose aim is to shock. It is a powerful thesis, but Bayles obfuscates her arguments by forcing all types of music and art into such rigid categories as "introverted modernism" and "extroverted modernism." She calls the tendency to shock, for example, "perverse modernism" and claims that this antiart, together with racial stereotypes, has kept African American music, which should be a humanizing antidote to the brutal and the obscene, out of the mainstream. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Danny Dunn Invisible Boy (Danny Dunn, #13)</h2><p>Cover has small rip, last page ripped but intact</p><p></p><h2>Astro Boy Omnibus Volume 3</h2><p>Stranded in the 20th century, Astro Boy must save Earth from a voracious Martian fungus--and save the intelligent organism from the hydrogen bomb!

Ex. xv. 6. &#34;Thy right hand, 0 Lord, is become glorious in power: Thy right hand, 0 Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.&#39;&#39; The last words of the Lord&#39;s Prayer suit as well with Easter Day, as the former words all along with Holy Week. I mean, when it ends, as you know it does sometimes, with acknowledging, &#34;Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever.&#34; Those words of glory, do you not see how naturally they come in, when, having prayed for pardon and deliverance, we are just receiving assurance of both by the Resurrection of our Lord and Saviour ? Christ rising from the dead is indeed the manifestation of God&#39;s Kingdom, Power and Glory in very many ways. His glory beamed out to the very eye, as our Lord moved about with His glorious and spiritual Body. His power He proved to be Almighty, when He raised Himself from the dead. And thereupon immediately followed His kingdom, which He took to Himself in heaven, when He sat down on the Right Hand of the Throne of God : andwhich also He set up on earth, when He sent down the Holy Ghost on the Apostles. A great deal might be said of these three subjects; the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory of the Most High; how Christ&#39;s Resurrection magnifies and proclaims them all: but I shall consider that Resurrection now in one way only, viz. as it was a victory: a great victory and triumph of our blessed Master over a set of very powerful and dangerous enemies. First, Christ&#39;s Resurrection was a victory, even in a visible and outward sense : a victory over the profane Jews and Romans. They thought to imprison Him, but He brake His prison-bars. They sealed the stone ; His Angel rolled it away. They set a watch of soldiers: they did but see the robe and countenance of Christ&#39;...</p><p></p><h2>Spectrum 21: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art</h2><p>The best-selling <i>Spectrum</i> series continues with this twenty-first lavishly produced annual.

No longer were fortresses designed to defend a ruler and his entourage, rather the whole of the citizen body had to be protected against any outside threats. The enceintes of these Greek city-states did not have to be very high or strong as city-state conflict was still decided by spear and shield, though some thought was still given to the science of fortification. This book details the construction and ongoing development of the defences that protected some of the most illustrious sites in Greece during the most famous period of her history.</p><p>Dr Nic Fields started his career as a biochemist before joining the Royal Marines. Having left the military, he went back to University and completed a BA and PhD in Ancient History at the University of Newcastle. He was Assistant Director at the British School at Athens, Greece, and then a lecturer in Ancient History at the University of Edinburgh. Nic is now a freelance author and researcher based in south-west France.</p><h2>Chicamacomico</h2><p>Chicamacomico transports us back to an earlier time on the Outer Banks, when folks on these isolated islands lived by their wits and determination. Without conveniences we take for granted today, they relied on sailing ships to bring supplies and deliver mail. Families often kept a horse and cart for transportation over long distances on sand paths, but travel within the village was usually on foot. Life saving teams trained constantly, ready to rescue passengers and crew from the frequent shipwrecks off the coast. In a place dominated by weather-by turns sublime and fierce-island culture was defined by simplicity, courage, and elf-sufficiency. Funny, poignant, and exciting, these stories offer a look back at an amazing place and a way of life long gone.</p><p>Hatteras Island has always been Elvin Hooper s home. He was born on July 9, 1949, in a twelve-bed hospital located in Buxton, North Carolina. The hospital was destroyed by a hurricane some years later. Just for the record, the location of his birth is also the site from which the very first wireless message was ever sent. It is now the home of a recreational park named the Fessenden Center, after the man who sent that message. The Hooper ancestry has been a part of Hatteras Island for generations and can be traced back as far as anyone can remember. The Hoopers were connected with the United States Lifesaving Service, even before it became the U.S. Coast Guard. Elvin grew up in the village of Salvo, formerly named Clarks, until the U.S. Postal Service changed the name of the village. Elvin attended Cape Hatteras School, located in Buxton. He later retired from the local county government as a former high school teacher and building code inspector. Elvin has served as a director of the Cape Hatteras Electric Membership Cooperative for more than twenty years. During one of his years as a high school carpentry teacher, Elvin s students constructed several rowboats, similar to those used before the days of motorized vessels, to ferry passengers and supplies from the villages to the larger vessels offshore. Elvin served fifteen years as Surfman Number Four on the Chicamacomico Lifesaving Service Re-enactment Team for the breeches buoy drill until the attacks of September 11, 2001, prohibited the firing of the black powder cannon also known as a Lyle gun used to transport the shot line to a vessel in distress. Some of Elvin s hobbies include fishing, hunting, music, and storytelling. He still works part time as a carpentry teacher at the high school in Buxton. Elvin also works full-time for the Hatteras Inlet Ferry operation. If he s not working, you might find him singing and playing his guitar with the Chicamacomico Band, or writing his second novel, Gull Island. Elvin is married with one daughter, named Kristina. He and his wife, Debra, have been married for forty years. Their family home is located in Buxton, North Carolina, in what was once known as the Cape Woods. Kristina is the main character in this book, and the book is dedicated to her.Elvin Hooper s generation caught the tail end of what was an isolated existence on old Hatteras Island, before a road connected it to a rapidly changing mainland. He does a splendid job painting a picture of life in Chicamacomico during those more primitive years, when life was physically tough, and the riches of nature gave sustenance. --Michael Halminski, Waves, NC</p><h2>The Shining</h2><p>Jack Torrance&#x2019;s new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

He lives in Maine with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.<br>&nbsp;<br>www.stephenking.com<i>Excerpted from Chapter One<br></i><br>Jack Torrance thought: Officious little prick. <br><br>Ullman stood five-five, and when he moved, it was with the prissy speed that seems to be the exclusive domain of all small plump men. The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would<br>mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker. <br><br>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk&#x2014;under the circumstances. <br><br>Ullman had asked a question he hadn&#x2019;t caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there&#x2019;s your son, of course.&#x201d; He glanced down at the application in front of him. &#x201c;Daniel. Your wife isn&#x2019;t a bit intimidated by the idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy is an extraordinary woman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your son is also extraordinary?&#x201d; <br><br>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. &#x201c;We like to think so, I suppose. He&#x2019;s quite self-reliant for a five-year-old.&#x201d; <br><br>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack&#x2019;s application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.<br><br>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We&#x2019;ll look at the hotel floor plans.&#x201d;<br><br>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plane of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman&#x2019;s cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel&#x2019;s kitchen, gearing down from lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Top floor,&#x201d; Ullman said briskly. &#x201c;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don&#x2019;t want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don&#x2019;t believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn&#x2019;t even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you wouldn&#x2019;t allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?<br><br>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.<br><br>&#x201c;The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,&#x201d; he said in a scholarly voice. &#x201c;Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views.&#x201d;<br><br>Could you at least spare the salestalk?<br><br>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.<br><br>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.<br>&#x201c;Forty rooms,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only about the basement,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;For the winter caretaker, that&#x2019;s the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall.&#x201d; He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook&#x2019;s operation as the boiler and the plumbing. &#x201c;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute...&#x201d;<br><br>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman&#x2019;s jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician&#x2019;s trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don&#x2019;t. This guy is a real heavyweight.<br><br>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker&#x2019;s suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply STAFF&nbsp; in small gold letters.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don&#x2019;t care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hun- dred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don&#x2019;t think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I&#x2019;m a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.<br><br>Ullman said: &#x201c;The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too proud of Harding and Nixon,&#x201d; Jack murmured.<br><br>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. &#x201c;It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the name,&#x201d; Jack said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold... except the Overlook. He funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a show- place. It was Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roque? &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his social secretary and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x201d; Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggily game behind the equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see that Ullman wasn&#x2019;t done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of it. <br><br>&#x201c;When he had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel people.<br><br>&#x201c;In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years, but I&#x2019;m happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook&#x2019;s accounts were written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack supposed that this fussy little man&#x2019;s pride was justified, and then his original dislike washed over him again in a wave.<br><br>He said: &#x201c;I see no connection between the Overlook&#x2019;s admittedly colorful history and your feeling that I&#x2019;m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order to cope with the problem, I&#x2019;ve installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can&#x2019;t get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a slow, hot grin&#x2014;the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin&#x2014;stretch across his mouth. &#x201c;Is that it? I&#x2019;m surprised Al didn&#x2019;t tell you. I&#x2019;ve retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He also told me about your last job... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don&#x2019;t believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady&#x2019;s case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your... uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970&#x2013;71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen&#x2019;s band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ullman said. &#x201c;The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the place really isn&#x2019;t cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#x201c;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours... under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn&#x2019;t hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below&#x2014;or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.<br><br>&#x201c;In the case of Grady,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?&#x201d; Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence&#x2014;murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He decided to press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he would stay cool.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he hurt them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He murdered the little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way. His leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he fell downstairs.&#x201d;</p><h2>Practical Indonesian Phrasebook: A Communication Guide (Periplus Language Books)</h2><p><b>This is a handy, travel&#x2013;sized Indonesian phrasebook with additional information about the Indonesian language.</b> <br><br>As any seasoned traveler knows, the ability to communicate in the language of the country you are visiting makes a very big difference in the experiences you have.

The first surprise is that Quofum, which seems to regularly slip in and out of existence, is actually there<i> </i>when they arrive. The second surprise is Quofum&#x2019;s wild biodiversity: The planet is not logical, ordered, or rational. But the real shock comes when the crew members not only find a killer in their midst but discover that their spaceship is missing&#x2013;along with all means of communication. Of course, the marooned teammates know nothing about the Great Evil racing toward the galaxy, or about Flinx, the only person with half a chance to stop it. Nor do they know that Quofum could play a crucial role in defeating the all-devouring monster from beyond.</p><p>Alan Dean Foster has written in a variety of genres, including hard science fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction.

With a full crew of only half a dozen there was no room on the low-budget expedition for specialists. At least among the scienti?c complement, everyone had been chosen for their ability to do work in several disciplines. Tellenberg hoped he would have the opportunity to exercise all of his considerable range of knowledge. Like the others, his greatest fear had been that they would emerge from space-plus to ?nd that the world they were charged with surveying and exploring was nothing more than a myth. <br><br>If it accomplished nothing else, the mission had already put that particular worry to rest. <br><br>Quofum was there, a thickly cloud-swathed world situated between the orbits of the system&#x2019;s second and third planets, exactly where the much earlier robot probe had predicted. As the <i>Dampier </i>decelerated toward its destination, he hurried forward to catch a ?rst glimpse of the new world through the sweeping port that dominated the bridge. Screens in his cabin and the lab could have provided much more detailed representations. But experiencing a new world in the form of a projection as opposed to viewing it in vivo was not the same thing. In this manner Tellenberg had previously been privileged to experience ?rst contact with two newly discovered planets. Quofum would be his third and, if the preliminary survey turned out to be valid, the most unusual. <br><br>An unusual world ?t for an unusual researcher. Twenty years ago Esra Tellenberg had suffered the loss of both arms and both legs in a laboratory accident. Only the telltale darkening of his skin below the shoulders and the knees marked him as a multiple regenerate. From research devoted to studying echinoderms skilled gengineers and doctors had long ago learned how to manipulate genes to induce severely damaged human beings to regrow lost limbs. A far better and more natural option than mechanical prosthetics, these bioengineered replacements were indistinguishable from the appendages they replaced&#x2013;except for one unanticipated difference. No matter how hard the cosmetic biologists worked at solving the problem, they always had a dif?cult time matching melanin. <br><br>Tellenberg&#x2019;s own body had regrown his arms and legs, but from shoulder and knee down his ?esh was noticeably darker. Body makeup would have rendered hues the same. Being a scientist and not a fashion model, he disdained their use. Thus clearly and unashamedly colored as a regenerate, it was to be expected that he would be nicknamed &#x201c;star?sh.&#x201d; He wore the label amiably, and with pride. <br><br>He was the last to arrive on the bridge. With a full complement of six, it was not crowded. Though its intensity and size had been greatly diminished by changeover and the drop back into normal space, the luminous violet of the posigravity ?eld projected by the ship&#x2019;s KK-drive still dominated the view ahead. As the <i>Dampier </i>continued to decelerate, the ?eld&#x2019;s strength steadily moderated, revealing the rest of the view forward and allowing them a ?rst glimpse of their destination. <br><br>&#x201c;Pretty substantial-looking. Not like something that would go popping in and out of existence.&#x201d; <br><br>While he was a master of multiple skills who could lay claim to several specialized credentials, Salvador Araza simply preferred to be called a maintenance tech. As well as a way of showing deference toward those from whom he had learned, it was also an honest expression of modesty. Tall, slender, and as dark as Tellenberg&#x2019;s regenerated forearms, he tended to keep to himself. So much so that the xenologist was surprised to hear the expedition&#x2019;s jack-of-all-trades venture an unsolicited opinion. More expressive even than his face, Araza&#x2019;s hands were by far his most notable feature. Tellenberg had seen them loop alloy he himself could not even bend, and in the next moment exhibit the skill of a surgeon while realigning components under a technician&#x2019;s magnifying scope. <br><br>Araza was standing just behind Boylan. In the case of the <i>Dampier, </i>the captain was the crew. Appointed though he was, he was still almost a ?gurehead. Interstellar KK-drive vessels essentially ?ew themselves, their internal operations and requisite calculations being far too byzantine for mere human minds to manage. Still, on any expedition someone had to be in charge, if only nominally. That responsibility fell to the gruff-voiced Nicholai Boylan. With his ?aring black beard, deep-set eyes, stocky build, and an occasionally distressing lack of personal hygiene, he struck Tellenberg as an eventual candidate for brain as well as body regeneration. <br><br>Contrastingly, the stunted and Neanderthal-looking captain was quite an accomplished amateur microbiologist. <br><br>Moselstrom N&#x2019;kosi (everybody called him Mosi) stood as close to the port as the sweeping instrument console would allow. He also hovered as near as he dared to his fellow xenologist Tiare Haviti. <br><br>Tellenberg didn&#x2019;t blame him. When opportunity allowed, he endeavored to do the same. It was always a delicate dance when single men and women were compelled to share the limited, enclosed space on board a small interstellar vessel. Given the uncertain and potentially risky nature of their destination, it was an application requirement that every potential crew member be unattached. All being mature adults, everyone knew their limits. When a fellow researcher was as alluring as Haviti, however, time tended to produce an accelerated compression of those limits. Aware of her unavoidable attractiveness and as adult and worldly as her male colleagues, she knew how to handle the inevitable attention. Proximity was tolerated: indeed, within the limited space on the ship that was allotted to living quarters it was inescapable. But that was all. <br><br>Haviti, Tellenberg found himself re?ecting, was not unlike plutonium. Though potentially dangerous it was also heavily shielded. With care, one could get quite close. Actual contact, however, might prove physically injurious. Having previously lost and subsequently been obliged to regrow four major appendages, he had no intention of risking any others. There was also the daunting and very real possibility that she was smarter than any of them. Wielded by the right tongue, lips, and larynx, a word could be as damaging as a whack. <br><br>Of the ?ve males on board, she let only Valnadireb get physically close to her. This intimacy occasioned no jealousy among Tellenberg and his colleagues. Not because Valnadireb was anything other than a virile adult male in his physical prime, but because their fellow xenologist was thranx. Though intellectually simpatico, Valnadireb and Haviti were as biologically incompatible as a chimp and a mantis, the latter being the Terran species to whom his kind&#x2019;s appearance was most often compared. A bit over a meter tall when standing on all four trulegs and the front set of foothands, rising to a meter and a half when standing on trulegs alone and utilizing both foothands and truhands for purposes of digital manipulation, the insectoid Valnadireb completed the ship&#x2019;s complement. Like the rest of the ship, the air on the bridge was permeated by the delicate perfume that was the natural body odor of his species. <br>Surrounded by colorful hovering projections both statistical and representative, a busy Boylan grunted a response to Araza&#x2019;s observation. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s there, alright. Every reading, she is coming back normal. Iron core, stony outer shell, breathable atmosphere, tolerable gravity. Lots of liquid water she has in her oceans. All normal.&#x201d; For an instant his crusty demeanor gave way to a twinkle in both eye and voice. &#x201c;Except for that remarkable alcohol content in the seas.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Nine percent,&#x201d; Mosi reiterated unnecessarily. Unnecessarily because each of them had committed to memory every known fact about their objective since long before their departure from Earth. <br>&#x201c;Maybe the place was originally discovered by a wandering race of long-lost master distillers,&#x201d; a deadpan Haviti commented. Though not unanticipated, the joke still generated a few chuckles on the bridge. <br>Tellenberg shared the captain&#x2019;s phlegmaticism. Gazing at the slowly rotating image of the solid globe ?oating before them, it was next to impossible to imagine something so large and substantial suddenly not being there. He tried to imagine it winking out of existence in the blink of an eye. To further the metaphor, he blinked. When he opened his eyes again, Quofum was still there. <br><br>Instrumentation malfunction, he told himself con?dently. There was no question about it, could be no other explanation. All down the line that had been focused on this world, there had occurred a succession of instrumental malfunctions.As Boylan methodically recited aloud one hard, cold, incontrovertible reading after another, Tellenberg felt increasingly con?dent he would be able to set his regenerated feet down on the target planet&#x2019;s surface without having to worry about them abruptly passing through it. <br><br>Having concluded the not-so-insigni?cant business of con?rming the world&#x2019;s existence, he was now eager to explore its surface to study the profusion of life-forms that the initial survey probe had insisted were there. It was an anticipation and excitement he knew was shared by his colleagues. This being such a small expedition there could well be ample discovery (and subsequent professional kudos) to go around. <br><br>&#x201c;I will run a ?nal prep on shuttle one.&#x201d; As Araza turned to go Boylan put up a hand to halt him. <br><br>&#x201c;Not so fast, my friend. You know the procedure.&#x201d; He let his gaze touch on each of those present. &#x201c;You all know the procedure.&#x201d; <br><br>The captain&#x2019;s declaration gave rise to a chorus of groans that was more resigned than resentful. Everyone knew you just didn&#x2019;t settle into orbit around an entirely new, unexplored world and dash down for a ramble. First, a prescribed number of observations and measurements would have to be made from orbit. <br><br>These would then have to be analyzed and their results approved by the ship&#x2019;s AI, the latter not being susceptible to complimentary words or physical blandishments by folks in a hurry to set foot on unfamiliar ground. Boylan would then review the ?nal breakdown. If approved, only then would the anxious scientists be permitted to crowd into the shuttle with their equipment and their expectations and allowed to descend to the alien surface. <br><br>Though as impatient as any of his colleagues, Tellenberg understood the need to follow procedure. Especially at a new site with as unusual a background as Quofum. With every orbit, the world below became more and more familiar to the team and to the ship, less and less potentially bizarre. <br><br>With the exception of its unusual potent oceans and pink-tinged atmosphere, they saw nothing from orbit to mark the globe as anything out of the ordinary. Viewed from high above, it boasted nothing as dramatic as the frozen seas of Tran-ky-ky or the endless metropolitan hive that was the thranx world of Amropolous, both of which Tellenberg had visited. There were mountains and valleys, rivers and deserts, islands and peninsulas, volcanoes and icecaps.A slightly larger pink-tinged Earth.Hopefully the ora and fauna would offer a bit more excitement than anything they were able to discern from orbit. <br><br>A week later the always reluctant, ever-circumspect Boylan grudgingly allowed as how it might ?nally be safe to go down and have a look around. <br><br>Anxious as the scientists were to commence their research, everyone knew that the first order of business was to choose an amenable location and establish a base camp. Lively argument ensued over whether to do this on the edge of a desert, mountain, riverine, or oceanic zone. Using his vote, Boylan settled the matter by opting for a temperate zone set-down where a sizable river running through native forest entered a shallow sea, a physical location that hopefully addressed as many requests as possible at the same time. Not a single member of the expedition&#x2019;s scienti?c team was entirely pleased with this choice, which showed that the captain had made the correct one. <br><br>Even though all the essential equipment was prefabricated and compacted, it took several round-trips in the shuttle to convey all of it safely to the surface. Arriving in a much larger vessel than the <i>Dampier, </i>a normal-sized expedition would have been equipped with a proper cargo shuttle. Still, the team managed. Only when the last tool, the last wall panel, the last section of roofing and self-routing sealant had been landed according to regulations, did Boylan give the go-ahead for construction to begin. <br><br>It was hard. Not because the trio of largely self-erecting buildings proved dif?cult to put up, but because as soon as they set foot on Quofum, every one of the scientists was overwhelmed by the incredible fecundity of their surroundings. It took an effort of will on the part of every member of the crew in addition to continuous cajoling by an exasperated Boylan to get them to attend to the business of putting together a place to sleep, eat, and work. Everyone wanted to explore the alien forest or the alien beach or the alien river. <br><br>There was life everywhere. Mosi N&#x2019;kosi, who thought he had been on bountiful worlds, avowed as how he had never seen anything like their new planetfall. Haviti was visibly overcome by both the opportunities that surrounded them as they worked to erect the camp and by its beauty. Being thranx, Valnadireb had never lived on worlds that were anything other than tropical in nature, but even he had to confess that for sheer richness of biota Quofum surpassed any place up to and including the incredibly lush thranx mother world of Hivehom. For its part, what the researchers initially took to be the more advanced native life-forms appeared as interested in the new arrivals as they did in them. <br><br>It took less than a week to set up the tripartite portable facility: living quarters in one extended rectangular structure, lab in another, equipment and gear storage in the third&#x2013;all laid out like the spokes of an incomplete wheel around the domed main entranceway and biolock. Each successive day they spent on Quofum without succumbing to local bacteria or other infectious microbiota, the less necessary the formal double entrance became. Still, no one suggested doing away with the additional security. Just because they had not yet encountered any hostile life-forms did not mean they did not exist. As experienced xenologists, they knew better. <br><br>They also knew that since there were only four of them in addition to Boylan and Araza, it was necessary to stay and work closely together until they had a far better conception of their surroundings. While having four researchers go off on four different tangents might prove to be individually gratifying and scientifically productive, it could also prove singularly fatal. So for the present they restrained themselves. <br><br>At least there were no arguments over what to do with the skimmer.None of the scientists requested its use.With a lifetime of work easily accessible within walking distance of the camp, none of the researchers felt a need to make use of the long-range vehicle. <br><br>While Boylan and Araza stayed behind to finalize and set up the remainder of the camp&#x2019;s internal components, everything from the food processing gear to the research lab, the energized scientists paired off. Haviti and Valnadireb chose to focus on the life in and around the river while N&#x2019;kosi and Tellenberg elected to study the transition zone where forest met the coast. <br><br>Appropriately equipped and armed, the two men restrained themselves from stopping every meter to spend an hour...</p><h2>The White Cottage Mystery</h2><p>When much-hated Eric Crowther is killed by a shotgun blast at the White Cottage, everyone who knew him has a motive for his murder</p><p><b>Margery Allingham</b> is ranked among the most distinguished and beloved detective fiction writers of the 'Golden Age' alongside Agatha Christie, Dorothy L.

Marc Barasch was the editor of a successful national magazine when he was diagnosed with cancer. For seven years---from the white corridors of hospitals to the quiet retreats of Tibetan teachers, from sweat lodges of Lakota medicine men to the doorsteps of survivors---he searched for life-giving lessons in the shadow of life-threatening illness. It is a book that is at once self-help and self-revelation; a tale so stunning told, an idea so originally developed, that it has the power to transform lives. <p>Barasch's own dramatic story unfolds like compelling literature---rich in metaphor, woven with dream images, and alive with the immediacy of his own triumphant struggle. But it goes much further: Using his own experiences as a starting point, he intereviewed dozens of others for whom serious illness became a catalyst for personal change.

But <i>The Greater Journey</i> is still a quintessentially American history. Between 1830 and 1900, hundreds of Americans--many of them future household names like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mark Twain, Samuel Morse, and Harriet Beecher Stowe--migrated to Paris. McCullough shows first how the City of Light affected each of them in turn, and how they helped shape American art, medicine, writing, science, and politics in profound ways when they came back to the United States. McCullough's histories have always managed to combine meticulous research with sheer enthusiasm for his subjects, and it's hard not to come away with a sense that you've learned something new and important about whatever he's tackled. <i>The Greater Journey is</i>, like each of McCullough's previous histories, a dazzling and kaleidoscopic foray into American history by one of its greatest living chroniclers. --<i>Darryl Campbell</i><b>David McCullough </b>has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman</i> and <i>John Adams</i>, and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

William heard the speculations from a group of idlers on the quay nearby, wondering whether it would be seen again.<br><br>&#x201c;Na, him be gone for good,&#x201d; said a ragged man of mixed blood, shaking his head. &#x201c;De ally-gator don&#x2019; take him, de water will.&#x201d;<br><br>A backwoodsman shifted his tobacco and spat into the water in disagreement.<br><br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s good for another day&#x2014;two, maybe. Them gristly bits what holds the head on, they dry out in the sun. Tighten up like iron. Seen it many a time with deer carcasses.&#x201d;<br><br>William saw Mrs. MacKenzie glance quickly at the harbor, then away. She looked pale, he thought, and maneuvered himself slightly so as to block her view of the men and the brown flood of high tide, though since it was high, the corpse tied to its stake was naturally not visible. The stake was, though&#x2014;a stark reminder of the price of crime. The pirate had been staked to drown on the mudflats several days before, the persistence of his decaying corpse an ongoing topic of public conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;Jem!&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie called sharply, and lunged past William in pursuit of his son. The little boy, red-haired like his mother, had wandered away to listen to the men&#x2019;s talk, and was now leaning perilously out over the water, clinging to a bollard in an attempt to see the dead pirate.<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie snatched the boy by the collar, pulled him in, and swept him up in his arms, though the boy struggled, craning back toward the swampish harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see the wallygator eat the pirate, Daddy!&#x201d;<br><br>The idlers laughed, and even MacKenzie smiled a little, though the smile disappeared when he glanced at his wife. He was at her side in an instant, one hand beneath her elbow.<br><br>&#x201c;I think we must be going,&#x201d; MacKenzie said, shifting his son&#x2019;s weight in order better to support his wife, whose distress was apparent. &#x201c;Lieutenant Ransom&#x2014;Lord Ellesmere, I mean&#x201d;&#x2014;he corrected with an apologetic smile at William&#x2014;&#x201c;will have other engagements, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true; William was engaged to meet his father for supper. Still, his father had arranged to meet him at the tavern just across the quay; there was no risk of missing him. William said as much, and urged them to stay, for he was enjoying their company&#x2014;Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s, particularly&#x2014;but she smiled regretfully, though her color was better, and patted the capped head of the baby in her arms.<br><br>&#x201c;No, we do have to be going.&#x201d; She glanced at her son, still struggling to get down, and William saw her eyes flicker toward the harbor and the stark pole that stood above the flood. She resolutely looked away, fixing her eyes upon William&#x2019;s face instead. &#x201c;The baby&#x2019;s waking up; she&#x2019;ll be wanting food. It was so lovely to meet you, though. I wish we might talk longer.&#x201d; She said this with the greatest sincerity, and touched his arm lightly, giving him a pleasant sensation in the pit of the stomach.<br><br>The idlers were now placing wagers on the reappearance of the drowned pirate, though by the looks of things, none of them had two groats to rub together.<br><br>&#x201c;Two to one he&#x2019;s still there when the tide goes out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Five to one the body&#x2019;s still there, but the head&#x2019;s gone. I don&#x2019;t care what you say about the gristly bits, Lem, that there head was just a-hangin&#x2019; by a thread when this last tide come in. Next un&#x2019;ll take it, sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoping to drown this conversation out, William embarked on an elaborate farewell, going so far as to kiss Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s hand with his best court manner&#x2014;and, seized by inspiration, kissed the baby girl&#x2019;s hand, too, making them all laugh. Mr. MacKenzie gave him rather an odd look, but didn&#x2019;t seem offended, and shook his hand in a most republican manner&#x2014;playing out the joke by setting down his son and making the little boy shake hands as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you kilt anybody?&#x201d; the boy inquired with interest, looking at William&#x2019;s dress sword.<br><br>&#x201c;No, not yet,&#x201d; William replied, smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;My grandsire&#x2019;s kilt two dozen men!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jemmy!&#x201d; Both parents spoke at once, and the little boy&#x2019;s shoulders went up around his ears.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, he has!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he is a bold and bloody man, your grandsire,&#x201d; William assured the little boy gravely. &#x201c;The King always has need of such men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My grandda says the King can kiss his arse,&#x201d; the boy replied matter- of-factly.<br><br>&#x201c;JEMMY!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie clapped a hand over his outspoken offspring&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;You know your grandda didn&#x2019;t say that!&#x201d; Mrs. MacKenzie said. The little boy nodded agreeably, and his father removed the muffling hand.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Grannie did, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s somewhat more likely,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie murmured, obviously trying not to laugh. &#x201c;But we still don&#x2019;t say things like that to soldiers&#x2014;they work for the King.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Jemmy, clearly losing interest. &#x201c;Is the tide going out now?&#x201d; he asked hopefully, craning his neck toward the harbor once more.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie said firmly. &#x201c;Not for hours. You&#x2019;ll be in bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. MacKenzie smiled at William in apology, her cheeks charmingly flushed with embarrassment, and the family took its leave with some haste, leaving William struggling between laughter and dismay.<br><br>&#x201c;Oy, Ransom!&#x201d;<br><br>He turned at his name, to find Harry Dobson and Colin Osborn, two second lieutenants from his regiment, evidently escaped from duty and eager to sample the fleshpots of Wilmington&#x2014;such as they were.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Dobson looked after the departing group, interested.<br><br>&#x201c;A Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie. Friends of my father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, married, is she?&#x201d; Dobson sucked in his cheeks, still watching the woman. &#x201c;Well, make it a bit harder, I suppose, but what&#x2019;s life without a challenge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Challenge?&#x201d; William gave his diminutive friend a jaundiced look. &#x201c;Her husband&#x2019;s roughly three times your size, if you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>Osborn laughed, going red in the face.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s twice his size! She&#x2019;d crush you, Dobby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what makes you think I mean to be on the bottom?&#x201d; Dobson inquired with dignity. Osborn hooted.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this obsession of yours with giantesses?&#x201d; William demanded. He glanced at the little family, now nearly out of sight at the end of the street. &#x201c;That woman&#x2019;s nearly as tall as I am!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, rub it in, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Osborn, who was taller than Dobson&#x2019;s five feet, but still a head shorter than William, aimed a mock kick at his knee. William dodged it and cuffed Osborn, who ducked and shoved him into Dobson.<br><br>&#x201c;Gennelmen!&#x201d; The menacing cockney tones of Sergeant Cutter brought them up sharp. They might outrank the sergeant, but not one of them would have the nerve to point this out. The entire battalion went in fear of Sergeant Cutter, who was older than God and approximately Dobson&#x2019;s height, but who contained within his diminutive physique the sheer fury of a full-sized volcano on the boil.<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant!&#x201d; Lieutenant William Ransom, Earl of Ellesmere and senior of the group, drew himself up straight, chin pressed back into his stock. Osborn and Dobson hastily followed his lead, quaking in their boots.<br><br>Cutter strode back and forth in front of them, in the manner of a stalking leopard. You could just see the lashing tail and the preliminary licking of chops, William thought. Waiting for the bite was almost worse than getting it in the arse.<br><br>&#x201c;And where&#x2019;s your troops, then?&#x201d; Cutter snarled. &#x201c;Sirs?&#x201d;<br><br>Osborn and Dobson at once began sputtering explanations, but Lieutenant Ransom&#x2014;for once&#x2014;walked on the side of the angels.<br><br>&#x201c;My men are guarding the Governor&#x2019;s Palace, under Lieutenant Colson. I&#x2019;m given leave, Sergeant, to dine with my father,&#x201d; he said respectfully. &#x201c;By Sir Peter.&#x201d;<br><br>Sir Peter Packer&#x2019;s was a name to conjure with, and Cutter abated in mid-spew. Rather to William&#x2019;s surprise, though, it wasn&#x2019;t Sir Peter&#x2019;s name that had produced this reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father?&#x201d; Cutter said, squinting. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lord John Grey, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er . . . yes,&#x201d; William replied cautiously. &#x201c;Do you . . . know him?&#x201d;<br><br>Before Cutter could reply, the door of a nearby tavern opened, and William&#x2019;s father came out. William smiled in delight at this timely appearance, but quickly erased the smile as the sergeant&#x2019;s gimlet gaze fixed on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you be a-grinnin&#x2019; at me like an &#x2019;airy hape,&#x201d; the sergeant began, in dangerous tones, but was interrupted by Lord John&#x2019;s clapping him familiarly on the shoulder&#x2014;something none of the three young lieutenants would have done if offered significant money.<br><br>&#x201c;Cutter!&#x201d; Lord John said, smiling warmly. &#x201c;I heard those dulcet tones and said to myself, why damn me if it isn&#x2019;t Sergeant Aloysius Cutter! There can&#x2019;t be another man alive who sounds so much like a bulldog that&#x2019;s swallowed a cat and lived to tell about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aloysius?&#x201d; Dobson mouthed at William, but William merely grunted briefly in response, unable to shrug, as his father had now turned his attention in his direction.<br><br>&#x201c;William,&#x201d; he said, with a cordial nod. &#x201c;How very punctual you are. My apologies for being so late; I was detained.&#x201d; Before William could say anything or introduce the others, though, Lord John had embarked upon a lengthy reminiscence with Sergeant Cutter, reliving high old times on the Plains of Abraham with General Wolfe.<br><br>This allowed the three young officers to relax slightly, which, in Dobson&#x2019;s case, meant a return to his earlier train of thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You said that red-haired poppet&#x2019;s a friend of your father&#x2019;s?&#x201d; he whispered to William. &#x201c;Find out from him where she&#x2019;s staying, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; hissed Osborn. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t even pretty! She&#x2019;s long-nosed as&#x2014;as &#x2014;as Willie!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see as high as her face,&#x201d; Dobson said, smirking. &#x201c;Her tits were right at eye-level, though, and those . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ass!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; Osborn stamped on Dobson&#x2019;s foot to shut him up as Lord John turned back to the young men.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you introduce me to your friends, William?&#x201d; Lord John inquired politely. Rather red in the face&#x2014;he had reason to know that his father had acute hearing, despite his artillery experiences&#x2014;William did so, and Osborn and Dobson both bowed, looking rather awed. They hadn&#x2019;t realized who his father was, and William was at once proud that they were impressed, and mildly dismayed that they&#x2019;d discovered Lord John&#x2019;s identity&#x2014;it would be all over the battalion before supper tomorrow. Not that Sir Peter didn&#x2019;t know, of course, but&#x2014;<br><br>He gathered his wits, realizing that his father was taking leave for them both, and returned Sergeant Cutter&#x2019;s salute, hastily but in good form, before hurrying after his father, leaving Dobby and Osborn to their fate.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw you speaking to Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,&#x201d; Lord John said casually. &#x201c;I trust they are well?&#x201d; He glanced down the quay, but the MacKenzies had long since disappeared from view.<br><br>&#x201c;Seemed so,&#x201d; Willie said. He was not going to ask where they stayed, but the impression the young woman had made on him lingered. He couldn&#x2019;t say if she was pretty or not; her eyes had struck him, though &#x2014;a wonderful deep blue with long auburn lashes, and fixed on him with a flattering intensity that had warmed the cockles of his heart. Grotesquely tall, of course, but&#x2014;what was he thinking? The woman was married&#x2014;with children! And red-haired, to boot.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve&#x2014;er&#x2014;known them long?&#x201d; he asked, thinking of the startlingly perverse political sentiments that evidently flourished in the family.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite some time. She is the daughter of one of my oldest friends, Mr. James Fraser. Do you recall him, by chance?&#x201d;<br><br>William frowned, not placing the name&#x2014;his father had thousands of friends, how should he . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not an English friend, you don&#x2019;t mean. Was it not a Mr. Fraser that we visited in the mountains, that time when you fell sick of the&#x2014;of the measle?&#x201d; The bottom of his stomach dropped a little, remembering the sheer terror of that time. He had traveled through the mountains in a daze of misery; his mother had died only a month before. Then Lord John had caught the measle, and William had been sure that his father was about to die likewise, leaving him completely alone in the wilderness. There hadn&#x2019;t been room for anything in his mind but fear and grief, and he retained only a jumble of confused impressions from the visit. He had some dim recollection that Mr. Fraser had taken him fishing and been kind to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; his father said, with a sidelong smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m touched, Willie. I should have thought you might recall that visit more because of your own misadventure than mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mis&#x2014;&#x201d; Memory rushed over him, succeeded by a flood of heat, hotter than the humid summer air. &#x201c;Thanks very much! I&#x2019;d managed to expunge that from my memory, until you mentioned it!&#x201d;<br><br>His father was laughing, and making no attempt to hide it. In fact, he was convulsed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Willie,&#x201d; he said, gasping and wiping his eyes with a corner of his handkerchief. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it; it was the most&#x2014;the most &#x2014;oh, God, I&#x2019;ll never forget what you looked like when we pulled you out of that privy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know it was an accident,&#x201d; William said stiffly. His cheeks burned with remembered mortification. At least Fraser&#x2019;s daughter hadn&#x2019;t been present to witness his humiliation at the time.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. But&#x2014;&#x201d; His father pressed the handkerchief to his mouth, his shoulders shaking silently.<br><br>&#x201c;Feel free to stop cackling at any point,&#x201d; William said coldly. &#x201c;Where the devil are we going, anyway?&#x201d; They&#x2019;d reached the end of the quay, and his father was leading them&#x2014;still snorting like a grampus&#x2014; into one of the quiet, tree-lined streets, away from the taverns and inns near the harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dining with a Captain Richardson,&#x201d; his father said, controlling himself with an obvious effort. He coughed, blew his nose, and put away the handkerchief. &#x201c;At the house of a Mr. Bell.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Bell&#x2019;s house was whitewashed, neat, and prosperous, without being ostentatious. Captain Richardson gave much the same sort of impression: of middle age, well-groomed and well-tailored, but without any notable style, and with a face you couldn&#x2019;t pick out of a crowd two minutes after seeing it.<br><br>The two Misses Bell made a much stronger impression, particularly the younger, Miriam, who had honey-colored curls peeping out of her cap, and big, round eyes that remained fixed on William throughout dinner. She was seated too far away for him to be able to converse with her directly, but he fancied that the language of the eyes was sufficient to indicate to her that the fascination was mutual, and if an opportunity for more personal communication should offer later . . . ? A smile, and a demure lowering of honey-colored lashes, followed by a quick glance toward a door that stood open to the side porch, for air.

In this beautiful work, translated into English for the first time, Pla transcribes his witnessings of basic truths: the waves of the sea, the hardness of rolled tobacco. The reader feels tangibly the pleasure with which Pla puts the sensual and real on paper.</p><p>Josep Pla (1897-1981) was a Catalan writer and journalist who lived in Spain, France, Italy, England, Germany, and Russia.

Combining general comment and the immediacy of close observation, he helps us see the world afresh." <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;Michael Eaude,&nbsp;<i>Catalonia Today</i></b> <br><br>"Josep Pla was a great noticer of things and places; his gaze was alert and dry; he wrote in a style which registered both the smallest detail and the large picture. His relationship to Catalan identity and Spanish history was complex, often ambiguous. His relationship, however, to the scene in front of him, or the days in which he lived, remains fascinating for its clarity, its sharpness, its originality and its wit. On display in his work is a glittering and sparkling sensibility." <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;Colm T�ib�n</b><br><br>"Pla&#x2019;s book of &#x201c;narrations&#x201d; shows us why this Catalan writer is considered the &#x201c;finest...of his generation.&#x201d; Each narrative piece is like a still-life, focusing on the tangible and memorable things of this world.

Outstanding."&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;&nbsp;Eileen Battersby,&nbsp;<i>The Irish TImes</i></b><br><br>"Considered one of the most influential Catalan authors of the twentieth century, [Pla] was born and raised in the Empord�, and over the course of his life wrote over 30,000 pages of prose in which he diligently catalogued the landscape and the life and habits of the people of the region. His complete works, published and republished over the years, contain marvelous descriptive passages that capture the landscape's history and its complex topography at once." <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;Words Without Borders</b><br><br>"An excellent translation by Bush... delightful.

The tone of the stories is often a bubbling good humor..." <b>&#x2014; Nick DiMartino</b><br><br>"<i>Life Embitters</i>, probably the best book in Josep Pla's vast body of work, is a literary feast which combines all his best qualities at once: the sharpness of the journalist, the modern style of the novelist, and the insight and lucidity of the autobiographer.&nbsp;Through these stories, Pla distills the experiences of a young man traveling around a dramatically changing Europe.&nbsp;This is the book I recommend whenever someone asks me about Catalan literature."<b>&nbsp;&#x2014; Jordi Punti, translator and author of <i>Lost Luggage</i></b></p><h2>Odyssey: The Photographs of Linda Connor</h2><p>Linda Connor&#39;s world-renowned photographs are global and sublime.

In the boldly colorful kitchen is a pop-up table and chairs, and a pop-out-from-the-wall set of cabinets, complete with a range that opens to reveal a baking pie, and many other distractions. Turn the "page" and you come to a bathroom complete with a mirror on the wall, a liftable toilet seat, and a little figure of Maisy to stand in the shower stall. Each room comes with a sheet containing cut-out objects like clothing and small furnishings, to be arranged at will.

A monumentally devastating plague leaves only a few survivors who, in a desert world, experience dreams of good and evil in confrontation and, through their choices, move toward an actual confrontation.</p><p>In 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of <i>The Stand</i> in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it.<p> <i>The Stand</i> is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Stephen King's most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world's population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil.</p><p> "I <i>love</i> to burn things up," King says. "It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... <i>The Stand</i> was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on <i>The Stand</i> came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke."</p><p> There is much to admire in <i>The Stand</i>: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.<br><br>And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abigail -- and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.<br><br>In 1978 Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.<br><br>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand</i> : <i>The Complete And Uncut Edition</i> includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.<br><br>For hundreds of thousands of fans who read <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p><h2>Bleed a River Deep (An Inspector Devlin Mystery)</h2><p>The third book in the internationally acclaimed Inspector Devlin series <p></p>When a U.

The gunman turns out to be an environmentalist who is the brother of an old friend of Devlin&#x2019;s. Then the shooter is found dead near the mine and Devlin begins to suspect that the business is a front for something far more sinister.</p><p>BRIAN MCGILLOWAY teaches at St. Columb&#x2019;s College in Ireland.BLEED A RIVER DEEP&nbsp;Chapter One <p>Friday, 29 September</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve uncovered a body out at the new mine.&#x2019;</p><p>It took me a few seconds to realize the speaker was addressing me. I looked up from my desk to where Superintendent Harry Patterson loomed over me.</p><p>&#x2018;Excuse me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve dug up a body out at the mine,&#x2019; he said irritably. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going out there. It&#x2019;s a dead body,&#x2019; he explained, turning to leave as he did so.</p><p>&#x2018;They generally are, if they&#x2019;ve had to dig them up,&#x2019; I muttered to his retreating back.</p><p>&#x2018;And keep the smart-arse comments to yourself,&#x2019; he snapped. &#x2018;Get a move on.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The leaves had just begun to turn, and some green still showed from the massive oaks behind our home when I left that morning; the cherry trees though were predominately golden, the leaves beginning to twist and sag. The air was still ripe and warm, the tannic scent of autumn starting to sharpen.</p><p>The fact that Patterson himself was attending the site was indication enough of the priority this find was being given. It wasn&#x2019;t so much what was found, but more where it was found: Orcas, a new goldmine opened two years previous near Barnes Gap, between Ballybofey and Donegal town, built on the promise of untold wealth to be shared with the whole community at some undefined point in the future. The body, Patterson explained in the car, had been found by some of the workers as they dug a new section of the mine. Patterson had been summoned by the owner himself, John Weston.</p><p>Weston was a second-generation Irish-American, whose family had moved back to &#x2018;the old country&#x2019; following his father&#x2019;s death. Bill Weston, John&#x2019;s father, had been a senator in the US, as well as being extremely wealthy. John had inherited every cent and had developed a number of business projects in Ireland, supported by friends of his father. The Orcas goldmine was the biggest and, it appeared, the most successful.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Patterson turned the car up a narrow side road, and Orcas hove into view: sixteen acres of Donegal bogland which now housed Ireland&#x2019;s largest goldmine. Preliminary tests conducted in the 1990s had shown the presence of several high-quality veins running through the rock under this land. One vein apparently stretched right across the sixteen acres and along the bed of the River Finn.</p><p>&#x2018;I wonder where...&#x2019; Patterson began, then stopped. There was no need to ask for directions. A convoy of Garda cars was already parked further up the road, alongside several 4x4s marked with Orcas livery. Half the force in Donegal must have been called out here, I thought. A good day to commit a crime anywhere else in the county.</p><p>The car made it almost to the site before getting stuck in a mud-filled puddle. We walked the rest of the way, our feet slipping on the wet path. Ahead of us a group of Guards had gathered, most still in their shirtsleeves. Some of them must have clocked Patterson, for they began to make themselves look busy. Some of the others just moved to the side of the road to let him past.</p><p>&#x2018;This is a right balls-up,&#x2019; he spat. &#x2018;Weston&#x2019;s just turned a record profit. Word was he was going to make a bigger investment. This could be enough to scare the fucker off.&#x2019;</p><p>As we drew level with the pit, the two men standing in it dropped their spades and scrabbled up the bank of clay they had shifted. The soil was almost black and scented the morning air with the smell of mould. It took me a second or two to pick out the body from the surrounding earth, for the only parts visible at this stage were the head and part of the upper arm.</p><p>But Patterson had no need to worry about Weston getting scared off. If there was a murder involved here, it had happened a few thousand years earlier, by the look of it.</p><p>The corpse was curled in on itself. The underlying muscle was outlined by skin the texture of old leather. The face had been flattened, presumably by the weight of earth pressing on top of it. The eyes were open, though the sockets long emptied. The mouth likewise was fixed ajar, the teeth, slightly gapped and blunted, were still lodged in the jawbone. There was certainly no sense of serenity in death: the face was twisted as if in agony. One arm protruded slightly from the dirt, the fingernails still attached to the talon-like hand.</p><p>&#x2018;Jesus, what is it?&#x2019; Patterson asked. &#x2018;Should we call the State Pathologist or the archaeologist?&#x2019;</p><p>A few of the men standing around grunted good-humouredly.</p><p>&#x2018;Still, at least he didn&#x2019;t die on our watch, eh, boys?&#x2019; he continued.</p><p>&#x2018;Do we need an ME to declare it dead?&#x2019; someone called. More laughter.</p><p>&#x2018;Best get Forensics up anyway,&#x2019; Patterson concluded. &#x2018;Just to keep it all official and that.&#x2019; Then he nodded to me: &#x2018;We&#x2019;re to see Weston.&#x2019;</p><p>As we travelled towards the main building, I looked out across the mine. When it first opened, it had been the subject of some controversy from environmental lobby groups, and I had had my own reservations about it, based on the little I had read in the papers. In reality, the mine itself was not at all what I had expected and much smaller than I&#x2019;d imagined, though the scarring it had already inflicted on the landscape was still significant.</p><p>Two large warehouses squatted side by side, their low corrugated roofs painted blood-red. Despite the size, only a few workmen were visible, and I counted a half-dozen cars parked in the staff area. One, a black Lexus with personalized number plates spattered with mud, revealed that Weston was already here.</p><p>We were directed to the only brick building in the compound, a white stucco three-storey block. A workman was at the front door, fastening a bronze plaque to the wall with an electric screwdriver. It caught the sun as he shifted it into position. He nodded as we passed, then snuffled into the back of his wrist and continued with his work.</p><p>Weston&#x2019;s receptionist was waiting for us when we entered the building. The floor was covered with thick carpet on which the image of a gold torc was repeated in a series of diagonal patterns. To one side of the reception desk stood a mahogany display cabinet, its contents lit by tiny halogen spotlights. The shelves of the cabinet glittered with gold jewellery. I wandered over and scanned the contents and their price tags while Patterson ingratiated himself with the twenty-year-old receptionist behind the desk. The smallest item in the cabinet &#x2013; a pair of stud earrings &#x2013; was priced at &#x20ac;350.</p><p>John Weston strode down the stairs towards us, his hand already outstretched, his smile fixed, businesslike, friendly, predatory. He smelt of expensive aftershave. His shirt cuffs sat just far enough past his jacket sleeve to reveal both the quality of the cloth and the gold cufflinks, fashioned again in the torc shape of his company&#x2019;s emblem. His skin was tanned, his hair neatly trimmed: he looked younger than his fifty years, despite the slight peppering of grey at his sideburns.</p><p>&#x2018;Gentlemen,&#x2019; he began, his accent discernible in the way he slurred the word, the &#x2018;t&#x2019; almost silent. &#x2018;Thanks for coming. Let&#x2019;s grab a coffee.&#x2019;</p><p>Clasping Patterson&#x2019;s hand in both of his, he shook it, then repeated the gesture with me.</p><p>&#x2018;John Weston,&#x2019; he said, smiling expansively.</p><p>&#x2018;Ben Devlin,&#x2019; I replied.</p><p>&#x2018;Ben,&#x2019; he repeated, with a nod of his head, as if to demonstrate that he was committing my name to memory. Then he placed his hand on my elbow and guided me towards the stairs, physically directing me. I resisted the movement and he stopped.</p><p>&#x2018;Just admiring your collection here,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;My wife would kill for something like that.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Beautiful, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x2019; he agreed, still smiling. His teeth were perfect and straight, and unnaturally white. I was vaguely aware that I was trying hard to find reasons not to like the man, despite the fact he had been nothing but gracious since our arrival.</p><p>&#x2018;Jackie,&#x2019; he said to the girl who had welcomed us. &#x2018;Have you those packs?&#x2019;</p><p>With a timid smile, Jackie produced two thick folders from beneath the desk where she sat. Both were bound in a leather cover emblazoned with the Orcas emblem. No expense spared.</p><p>&#x2018;And choose something pretty for Ben&#x2019;s wife, would you?&#x2019; he added, winking at me conspiratorially, then directing me towards the stairs again before I had a chance to decline the offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weston&#x2019;s office itself was the size of the entire ground floor of the Garda station in Lifford where I was based. He occupied a corner room on the top floor of the building so that, from his desk, he could survey his empire both to left and to right. As we entered his office he flicked a switch and the blinds on the windows automatically pulled back, revealing both the expanse of his goldmine and, to the other side, the majesty of the Donegal landscape in which he had quite literally carved his niche.</p><p>&#x2018;Beautiful country,&#x2019; he observed. &#x2018;Absolutely stunning.&#x2019;</p><p>I began to suspect that Weston spoke only in superlatives. I also noticed he was being careful to compliment the landscape, and not the additions he had made to it.</p><p>I looked down over the forest to our left, through which I could catch a glimpse of the Carrowcreel, a tributary snaking its way towards the River Finn. The light glittered on its surface as if on shards of broken mirror.</p><p>&#x2018;Almost a pity to industrialize it,&#x2019; I said, earning a warning glance from Patterson, who had continued his ingratiation since our arrival, echoing Weston&#x2019;s observations on the weather as we had climbed the two flights of stairs to his office.</p><p>&#x2018;Almost,&#x2019; Weston agreed with a smile. &#x2018;This is my country too, Inspector. I&#x2019;m not going to damage it. Part of our licence is our guarantee that we will leave this area as we found it. Every clod that has been dug up will be replaced. It will be as if we were never here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And when will that be?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>&#x2018;When it&#x2019;s no longer profitable to remain, I suppose,&#x2019; he said, his palms held open in front of him in a gesture of honesty. &#x2018;I am a businessman, after all.&#x2019; He waited a beat, then continued, &#x2018;Though of course this was all bogland before we arrived. And to bogland it must return, despite the fact that the bogs themselves were artificially created by some Iron Age entrepreneur.&#x2019;</p><p>I nodded slightly, having taken his point.</p><p>&#x2018;Which leads me nicely on to our friend out there. I&#x2019;m no forensics specialist, but I&#x2019;m guessing he or she didn&#x2019;t die in this century. Is that right?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It would appear so,&#x2019; Patterson said, eager to assert his role in the conversation. &#x2018;It shouldn&#x2019;t cause too much disruption to your works, Mr Weston.&#x2019;</p><p>Weston nodded his head. &#x2018;An amazing country,&#x2019; he stated, then pointed a finger at us. &#x2018;I forgot that coffee, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019; he said, still good-humoured. He pressed the intercom button on his phone and instructed Jackie to bring us coffee and some biscuits, which she did with startling speed.</p><p>Once we had settled into our drinks, Weston explained why he had summoned us.</p><p>&#x2018;The packs you&#x2019;ve been given detail the history of the Orcas mine &#x2013; including our financial reports for the past tax year. You&#x2019;ll notice that last year we enjoyed record profits. As a result of this, we have a special visitor coming both to formally open the site and, I suppose, to officially acknowledge the Irish-American finances that have made this all possible.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s the visitor?&#x2019; Patterson asked.</p><p>&#x2018;An old friend of my father&#x2019;s,&#x2019; Weston said. &#x2018;Senator Cathal Hagan.&#x2019;</p><p>We both nodded. Hagan was well known, even in Ireland. He&#x2019;d been an outspoken Irish-American senator, who had established links with Heal Ireland, ostensibly an Irish aid charity but in fact a front that funded Republican causes in the North.</p><p>&#x2018;Obviously, anything we can do to help, sir,&#x2019; Patterson offered.</p><p>Weston nodded soberly. &#x2018;Thank you, Harry. We&#x2019;ll have to work together on this. The Senator will bring some security with him, and I know a number of the other divisions will be involved in his trip, but we&#x2019;ll be dependent on yourself and Ben to ensure there&#x2019;s no trouble while he&#x2019;s here. Obviously this information is between the three of us for now, gentlemen.&#x2019;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t need to ask why there would be trouble. Hagan had called on those senators who expressed reservations over the invasion of Iraq a few years back to be strung up for failing America in its hour of need. Post-9/11 he was an outspoken critic of terrorism in all its forms, apparently forgetting that the charity he had spearheaded in the 1980s had paid for most of the Republican movement&#x2019;s weaponry in Ireland. His arrival could attract the growing anti-war lobby, which had already organized more than one demonstration in Ireland over the past few years.</p><p>&#x2018;Do you expect trouble?&#x2019; Patterson asked, then seemed to gauge the stupidity of the question by our expressions, for he immediately added, &#x2018;Beyond the usual, I mean.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Senator Hagan has his detractors, both at home and abroad, as I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re aware, Harry. In addition, the environmental lobby seem determined to vilify us at every turn, despite the fact that, before a sod was cut here, we invested millions on an environmental impact study, to whose recommendations we have adhered in every point.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How much security will he be bringing with him?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>&#x2018;One or two personal security men, I suspect,&#x2019; Weston answered. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s retired now, Ben, so he isn&#x2019;t afforded quite the level of protection he once was.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So we&#x2019;ll be responsible for the bulk of it,&#x2019; Patterson said. It was a statement rather than a question, but Weston nodded.</p><p>&#x2018;When&#x2019;s the visit?&#x2019;</p><p>Weston grimaced, then, leaning forward in his seat, consulted a document on the desk before him, although he clearly knew the date by heart: &#x2018;Monday, ninth of October.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Following coffee and preliminary security discussions, Patterson and I were escorted back downstairs. Weston gestured to the welcome packs we had been given.</p><p>&#x2018;Everything you could ever want to know about our company is in those packs, gentlemen.&#x2019;</p><p>As we shook hands to leave, the receptionist approached nervously, holding a blue box. She passed it to Weston, who opened it and inspected the contents.</p><p>&#x2018;Beautiful choice, Jackie,&#x2019; he said, nodding with admiration. Clearly relieved to have completed this latest task to Weston&#x2019;s satisfaction, Jackie smiled and hurried off again. I was a little taken aback when Weston handed me the box. &#x2018;I hope your wife likes it, Ben,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>I opened the box, a little confused and feeling my face flush with embarrassment. Inside it sat a thick gold necklace, which I was sure I had seen in the display cabinet earlier with a price tag in excess of &#x20ac;3,000.</p><p>I held the box out towards Weston again. &#x2018;Thank you, sir, but I can&#x2019;t accept this. It&#x2019;s...it&#x2019;s far too much.&#x2019;</p><p>He stood his ground, however, his hands clasped in military fashion behind his back, his smile fixed. &#x2018;No, I insist, Ben.&#x2019;</p><p>I could think of nothing to say, and so in the end simply thanked him for his generosity, though as we left the building to return to Patterson&#x2019;s car I could not help feeling that, in some way, I had accepted more than just a gift for my wife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Bloody hell, Devlin,&#x2019; Patterson said as we pulled out on to the main road. &#x2018;That thing costs a fucking fortune.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t ask him for it,&#x2019; I said defensively.</p><p>&#x2018;You may as well have done,&#x2019; he retorted, and I suspected that part of his reaction was jealousy that he had not been similarly gifted. &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t fuck up this visit now,&#x2019; he added, without looking at me. &#x2018;Me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You. I&#x2019;m putting you in charge of it,&#x2019; he said. Then, nodding towards the box I held in my hand, he added, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve already been paid for it, after all.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We had only trav...</p></p><h2>Book of Common Order</h2><p>Really nice clean copy of this book.</p><p></p><h2>LaFontaine&#39;s Legacy: The Last Flies from an American Master</h2><p><p>Gary LaFontaine became world famous for his innovative trout fly patterns.

The movie <i>Hoosiers</i> rose from humble beginnings to become a classic. Inspired by the smallest school ever to win Indiana&#x2019;s one-class basketball tournament, <i>Hoosiers</i> interweaves themes of redemption and second chances, of family and small-town life, of having faith and living your dream. It&#x2019;s been called one of the most inspiring motion pictures of all time. But the story of the movie&#x2019;s creation is just as inspiring. The first-time filmmakers&#x2019; goal was to create an entertaining, authentic, and emotionally resonant movie--within the confines of a small budget and a short schedule. In attempting to portray the intense love of basketball known as &#x201c;Hoosier hysteria,&#x201d; the movie&#x2019;s creators took on an immense challenge. With the help and support of thousands of Indiana residents, both during and after production, the filmmakers saw <i>Hoosiers</i> succeed well beyond their expectations. This book takes you on the journey that was the making of <i>Hoosiers</i>, as experienced by the filmmakers, actors, crew members, and extras. The narrative is rich with detail, incorporating little-known facts and trivia from behind the scenes. The book concludes by examining why <i>Hoosiers</i> still scores with audiences young and old so many years after its release.</p><p></p><h2>Red Kite, Blue Kite</h2><p><br>When Tai Shan and his father, Baba, fly kites from their roof and look down at the crowded city streets below, they feel free, like the kites.&nbsp;Baba loves telling Tai Shan stories while the kites--one red, and one blue--rise, dip, and soar together. Then, a bad time comes. People wearing red armbands shut down the schools, smash store signs, and search houses. Baba is sent away, and&nbsp;Tai Shan goes to live with Granny Wang.&nbsp;Though father and son are far apart, they have a secret way of staying close. Every day they greet each other by flying their kites&#x2014;one red, and one blue&#x2014;until Baba can be free again, like the kites. <br><br>Inspired by the dark time of the Cultural Revolution in China, this is a soaring tale of hope that will resonate with anyone who has ever had to love from a distance.<br><br></p><p>Ji-li Jiang (www.jilijiang.com) was born in Shanghai , China.

Tai Shan loves flying kites with his widower father, and the spacious double-page spreads, with dark lines and warm shades of brown and red, show the bond between father and son. Then bad times come, and Baba is sent to a labor camp, while Tai Shan lives with Granny Wang in a nearby village. As secret signals to each other, the boy and his father fly their kites high in the sky. At first, they can meet on weekends, but then Baba is sent far away. True to the small boy&#x2019;s viewpoint, the spare, poetic words capture the action as the kites &#x201c;rise and dive, soaring and hanging together&#x201d;; the emptiness of being apart; and the final, joyful reunion. Even young readers will see the kite flying as a metaphor for freedom. A great choice for classroom sharing and discussion.

He was quarrelsome and his literary feuds were as garguantuan as his friendships were profound and throughout his sense of humour always prevailed. Born in France, Belloc served in the French army when he was 18 and, pursuing the woman he loved, he walked to Los Angeles from New York just before going up to Oxford. He quickly made a reputation with his novels, essays and poems, but it is for his flamboyant way of living, which reads like a novel that he will be remembered. Having had full access to all the Belloc archives, A.N. Wilson gives an unprecedented view of Belloc&#39;s married life, his friendships, and the movement of mind in this biography.</p><p>A.N.

Drawing on previously unutilized archival material, Ute Deichmann, herself a biologist, explores not only what happened to the biologists forced to emigrate but also the careers, science, and crimes of those who stayed in Germany. </p><p> <i>Biologists under Hitler</i> combines exhaustive research with capsule biographies of key scientists to overturn certain assumptions about science under the Nazi regime. Biological research, for instance, was neither neglected nor underfunded during World War II; funding by the German Research Association (DFG) in fact increased tenfold between 1933 and 1938, and genetic research in particular flourished. Deichmann shows that the forced emigration of Jews had a less significant impact in biology than in other fields. Furthermore, she reveals that the widely observed decline in German biology after 1945 was not caused primarily by the Third Reich's science policy or by the expulsion of biologists but was due to the international isolation of German scientists as part of the legacy of National Socialism. Her book also provides overwhelming evidence of German scientists' conscious misrepresentation after the war of their wartime activities. In this regard, Deichmann's capsule biography of Konrad Lorenz is particularly telling. </p><p> Certain to be regarded as the most thorough and comprehensive account of biological science in Nazi Germany, <i>Biologists under Hitler</i> will interest historians of science, historians of the Nazi era, and biologists, as well as those who wish to learn about the relationship between scientific truth and political realities. </p></p><p>We are now fortunate to have an English edition of this distinguished work, the first book-length treatment of the history of biology under the Nazis. Deichmann shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the biological sciences were handsomely supported during the Nazi period.-Robert Proctor, Pennsylvania State University<b>Ute Deichmann</b> is a Research Fellow at the Institute for Genetics of the University of Cologne.

In these one-sentence vignettes, the fields of philosophy, physics, and psychology marry into uproariously funny trysts of paradoxical play, each one like a piece of deluxe brain-candy which is no less serious in its treatment of the human condition as it is absurd. We are not only afforded a chance to glimpse into the thoughts of this wondrously twisted thinker, we are challenged to follow him into the surprising and impossible rabbit holes of language he unearths on every page.<br> <br>F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote: "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time -- and still retain the ability to function." This catalog of jokes, like a set of modern Zen koans, puts you through this mental test, playing with the principles of paradox, polarity, and incongruity to take you from the comforts of clich� to the chasms of contradiction with just a few strokes of a pen.<br><br>"Eisenberg uses verbal gymnastics to twist and stretch the boundaries of logic, throwing the semantics of everyday expressions into question - hopefully stirring our collective conversation about meaning and consciousness forward." <br>---<br>"An ideal gift for people who don't read books!"<br>"The book about quieting the mind that everyone is talking about."<br>"A revolutionary approach to maintaining the status quo."</p><p><b>Michelangelo wrote: "You keep sculpting, and sculpting, and sculpting, until... there is nothing left to take away."</b>&nbsp;And that is how I feel about this book. This material, this "carefully curated collection of contradictions" started having a logic of its own years ago. My job as a writer was to be dutiful to the muse, to follow where she led, to keep playing with language and word combinations in all their perplexing permutations, and in the end to keep<b>&nbsp;editing out mediocre content&nbsp;</b>until there was<b>&nbsp;"nothing left to take away."</b><b>-</b>I wrote this book to uplift my friends, real and imagined, far and near, who ponder the perennial questions about the human condition (which usually have no solid answers), to keep them&nbsp;<b>entertained &amp; challenged</b>&nbsp;for a few turns in the road. To keep them&nbsp;<b>engaged &amp; comforted&nbsp;</b>for a few twists in the path.-Don't worry about the content being dogmatic or didactic. Or conclusive. The point of the book is to&nbsp;<b>excavate &amp; examine</b>&nbsp;the everyday language we use, to&nbsp;<b>pose questions</b>&nbsp;about the logic and semantics which shape our thoughts, and to&nbsp;<b>stir our collective conversations</b>&nbsp;about the natures of time, self &amp; society a little bit forward.&nbsp;<b>-</b><b>"The desire to spread levity in the world weighs heavily upon me."

His career as surveyor, architect, engineer took him to many places in the US, and in close contact with Thomas Jefferson. Also known for designing the Richmond Penitentiary, the Bank of Pennsylvania and the Baltimore Cathedral, as well as the historical study and annotation of the Susquehanna River Survey Map. Latrobe played a major role in the creation of the American technological community, publishing many scientific papers, technical reports, newspaper and journal articles and essays. Latrobe moved from Richmond to Philadelphia in late 1798 to execute his first great commission, the Bank of Pennsylvania. He sporadically wrote in the journals printed in this volume while in such cities as Philadelphia, New Castle, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where he served as architect of the U.S. Capitol. He kept journals more regularly while in New Orleans during the last year of his life - he died in 1820. In addition to recording daily events, Latrobe made observations on a wide variety of topics, from the origins of yellow fever to slavery and black music in New Orleans. His pen-and-ink drawings and watercolors compliment the text.</p><p>Benjamin Henry Latrobe wrote the journals that comprise this volume during a span of years (1799-1820) that marked the most creative and productive period of his career as an architect and engineer.</p><h2>Via delle Oche (De Luca Trilogy, Book 3)</h2><p>It is 1948. Italy's fate is soon to be decided in bitterly contested national elections. A man has been found dead in via delle Oche, at the center of Bologna's notorious red light district. The city fathers would like to disguise the man's death as a suicide. But Commissario De Luca knows better. While the man hanging from a rafter does have a noose around his neck and an overturned stool beneath him, when the stool is righted, his feet don't reach the seat. "Normal enough that a hanged man grows a little longer if he's left a while," De Luca quips. "But I've never heard of one getting shorter."<br>As always, De Luca is unwilling to look the other way when evidence in the man's murder points to local politicians and members of the Bologna police force. The brutal worlds of crime and politics conspire once again, and in this installment of the renowned De Luca trilogy, sex for money is added into the mix. As elections creep nearer, the death count escalates with every new lead. De Luca is so close to the truth he can smell it, and it reeks of danger.</p><p><b>About the Author</b><br> Described as �&#x201c;a noir master�&#x201d; by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, Carlo Lucarelli is one of Italy�&#x2019;s best-loved crime writers. He began his career with the popular De Luca trilogy (<i>Carte Blanche</i>, <i>The Damned Season</i>, <i>Via delle Oche</i>) and has since published over a dozen novels and collections of stories.<br><br> <b>About the Translator</b><br> Michael Reynolds�&#x2019; translations include <i>The Big Question</i> and <i>The Miracle of the Bears </i> by Wolf Erlbruch, and all three books in Carlo Lucarelli�&#x2019;s De Luca trilogy. He is the author of <i>Sunday Special</i>, and <i>La notte di Q</i>, a children�&#x2019;s tale illustrated by Brad Holland.The final volume in Lucarelli&#x2019;s De Luca trilogy finds the Italian policeman back on the force, this time in Bologna in 1948. Political reprisals are still the order of the day, as the postwar climate remains tumultuous. De Luca is trying to stay under the radar, his past employment with Mussolini&#x2019;s secret police likely to derail his career at any moment. Self-preservation dictates that he stay away from a hot-potato case involving the suicide (or murder) of a gofer at one of Bologna&#x2019;s licensed brothels, but De Luca can&#x2019;t resist the temptation to follow the clues wherever they lead, which, inevitably, is straight toward a political scandal. Set in the days prior to a contentious general election pitting Communists against right-wing Christian Democrats, the novel may prove difficult to follow for those not familiar with postwar Italian politics, but the general milieu&#x2014;a cop trying to do his job but running afoul of departmental turf-builders&#x2014;will strike home with anyone who has watched The Wire (or even just worked in any kind of office). Give this to fans of Michael Dibdin&#x2019;s Aurelio Zen novels. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Islanders: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>"One of my own favorite writers." </strong>&#x2013;<strong>Elin Hilderbrand</strong></p><p><strong>Named a Best Beach Read of Summer by <em>Vulture</em>, <em>PureWow</em>, <em>She Reads</em> and <em>Women.com</em></strong></p><p><strong>J.

It focuses on two critical periods in Korean history and asks how key concepts and symbols were created and integrated into political programs to create an original Korean understanding of national identity, the nation-state, and nationalism. Looking at the often-ignored questions of representation, narrative, and rhetoric in the construction of public sentiment, Andre Schmid traces the genealogies of cultural assumptions and linguistic turns evident in Korea's major newspapers during the social and political upheavals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br>Newspapers were the primary location for the re-imagining of the nation, enabling readers to move away from the conceptual framework inherited from a Confucian and dynastic past toward a nationalist vision that was deeply rooted in global ideologies of capitalist modernity. As producers and disseminators of knowledge about the nation, newspapers mediated perceptions of Korea's precarious place amid Chinese and Japanese colonial ambitions and were vitally important to the rise of a nationalist movement in Korea.</p><p>Turning from more traditional modes of historical inquiry, <i>Korea Between Empires</i> explores the formative influence of language and social discourse on conceptions of nationalism, national identity, and the nation-state.Andre Schmid is associate professor of East Asian Studies at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>Music for Very Little People: Book Only</h2><p>(Boosey &amp; Hawkes Scores/Books). A wealth of material including baby bouncing games, wiggles, tickles, tapping, clapping, games and lullabies. While appropriate for very young children, many of the activities can be used in Pre-K classrooms as well.</p><p></p><h2>Parents in the Pigpen, Pigs in the Tub (Picture Puffins)</h2><p>Tired of their usual routine, the farm animals insist on moving into the house, so the family decides to move into the barn, but eventually everyone tires of this new arrangement</p><p>It's a barnyard switcharoo when the animals get a glimpse of life on the other side of the pasture gate. Laments like "That sure looks better than the stuff they feed us" and "They got no flies in there neither" prompt a bevy of beasts to move into the house and demand cornflakes and snug beds. Ehrlich and Kellogg (who previously teamed up for the Leo, Zack and Emmie beginning readers series) invest the naively accommodating family with a goofy cheerfulness that provides much of the book's humor. Pa, Ma, Willy, Billy, Millie and the girl who narrates are blithely oblivious to the household havoc being wreaked by the animals (rendered in Kellogg's characteristically cluttered watercolors). Things finally get out of hand (Ma starts snoring during the Sunday sermon, the pigs flood the house) and the humans flee to the now-vacant barn, completing the swap. Eventually, of course, all creatures yearn for the comforts of home and the groups agree to trade back. A Thanksgiving dinner, filled with extra helpings of silliness, concludes the tale with a celebration of newfound mutual respect. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 2-A preposterous story about farm animals that switch domiciles with their human caretakers. These creatures not only talk and walk on two legs, but they're also greedy and pushy and want all of the advantages of civilization. And so, they move into the farmhouse. Ehrlich's text begs to be read aloud in an exaggerated country twang, while Kellogg's watercolor illustrations are rambling and full of humorous details. The human parents and their brood of goofy-looking children are good-natured pushovers, and they really don't mind living outside. The pictures depict ferociously funny expressions on some of the animals-a pig brushing his teeth, sending toothpaste foam everywhere; hysterically quacking ducks; indignant sheep. After the beasts have totally trashed the house-because they are animals, after all-they invite the family to come back. The farmers gape at the disaster before them, but somehow they take it all in stride.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. W. Ross Ashby was an English psychiatrist and a pioneer in cybernetics, the study of complex systems. His two books, &#34;Design for a Brain&#34; and &#34;An Introduction to Cybernetics&#34;, were landmark works. They introduced exact and logical thinking into the nascent discipline and were highly influential. This work begins with the premise that the nervous system behaves adaptively and the hypothesis that it is essentially mechanistic; it assumes that these two data are not irreconcilable. It proceeds by first developing an adequately rigorous logic of mechanism, considering such topics as dynamic systems, stability and homeostasis. It then applies this logic to the behaviors of living organisms, and shows that we may deduce that certain types of behavior must be produced by certain types of mechanism.</p><p></p><h2>Reading Street, Common Core, Grade 1.4 Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Love to teach!

This book seeks to challenge the idea that racism is inevitable by taking a critical look at the origins and history of racism in Britain and abroad. It looks in particular at the experience of the last 40 years in Britain, from the struggles of the 1970s through the 1981 riots, Stephen Lawrence and the war on terror. Highlighting key examples of black and white unity, resistance and struggle in the US and Britain, it intervenes in current debates about racism and sets out the Marxist case for how best to fight it. The eight authors shared Marxist approach and activist history ensure a smooth narrative and a clear argument for the struggle for liberation today.</p><p></p><h2>Kiss of Surrender: A Deadly Angels Book (Deadly Angels, 2)</h2><p><p>What romance reader can resist a hero who is both Viking...and vampire?

When the government issued a writ for his arrest, Rousseau was forced to flee Paris and live as a hunted man. In THE SOCIAL CONTRACT, Rousseau rejects the notion that human beings must choose between being governed and being free and asserts that individual freedom is linked with civil society only when its members live according to their consciences, not as slaves of their passions. Of paramount importance to Rousseau's argument is his distinction between the completely self-interested human being (the brute) and the one who lives with a sense of moral obligation (the man of reason). Rousseau also elaborates his concepts of the "general will" and the "will of all". This volume also contains the early treatises, A DISCOURSE ON THE ARTS &amp; SCIENCES, A DISCOURSE ON THE ORIGIN OF INEQUALITY, AND A DISCOURSE ON POLITICAL ECONOMY.</p><p></p><h2>Trash</h2><p>In an unnamed Third World country, in the not-so-distant future, three &#x201c;dumpsite boys&#x201d; make a living picking through the mountains of garbage on the outskirts of a large city. <br><br>One unlucky-lucky day, Raphael finds something very special and very mysterious.

With twists and turns, unrelenting action, and deep, raw emotion, <i>Trash </i>is a heart-pounding, breath-holding novel.</p><p>Andy Mulligan was brought up in South London. He worked as a theater director for ten years before travels in Asia prompted him to retrain as a teacher. He has taught English and drama in Britain, India, Brazil, and the Philippines. He now divides his time between London and Manila.1<br><br>My name is Raphael Fernandez and I am a dumpsite boy.<br><br>People say to me, 'I guess you just never know what you'll find, sifting through rubbish! Today could be your lucky day.' I say to them, 'Friend, I think I know what I find.' And I know what everyone finds, because I know what we've been finding for all the years I've been working, which is eleven years. It's the one word: stuppa, which means--and I'm sorry if I offend--it's our word for human muck. I don't want to upset anyone, that's not my business here. But there's a lot of things hard to come by in our sweet city, and one of the things too many people don't have is toilets and running water. So when they have to go, they do it where they can. Most of those people live in boxes, and the boxes are stacked up tall and high. So, when you use the toilet, you do it on a piece of paper, and you wrap it up and put it in the trash. The trash bags come together. All over the city, trash bags get loaded onto carts, and from carts onto trucks or even trains--you'd be amazed at how much trash this city makes. Piles and piles of it, and it all ends up here with us. The trucks and trains never stop, and nor do we. Crawl and crawl, and sort and sort.<br><br>It's a place they call Behala, and it's rubbish-town. Three years ago it was Smoky Mountain, but Smoky Mountain got so bad they closed it down and shifted us along the road. The piles stack up--and I mean Himalayas: you could climb for ever, and many people do . . . up and down, into the valleys. The mountains go right from the docks to the marshes, one whole long world of steaming trash. I am one of the rubbish boys, picking through the stuff this city throws away.<br><br>'But you must find interesting things?' someone said to me. 'Sometimes, no?'<br><br>We get visitors, you see. It's mainly foreigners visiting the Mission School, which they set up years ago and just about stays open. I always smile, and I say, 'Sometimes, sir! Sometimes, ma'am!'<br><br>What I really mean is, No, never--because what we mainly find is stupp.<br><br>'What you got there?' I say to Gardo.<br><br>'What d'you think, boy?' says Gardo.<br><br>And I know. The interesting parcel that looked like something nice wrapped up? What a surprise! It's stupp, and Gardo's picking his way on, wiping his hands on his shirt and hoping to find something we can sell. All day, sun or rain, over the hills we go.<br><br>You want to come see? Well, you can smell Behala long before you see it. It must be about two hundred football pitches big, or maybe a thousand basketball courts--I don't know: it seems to go on for ever. Nor do I know how much of it is stupp, but on a bad day it seems like most of it, and to spend your life wading through it, breathing it, sleeping beside it--well . . . maybe one day you'll find 'something nice'. Oh yes.<br><br>Then one day I did.<br>I was a trash boy since I was old enough to move without help and pick things up. That was what?--three years old, and I was sorting.<br><br>Let me tell you what we're looking for.<br><br>Plastic, because plastic can be turned into cash, fast--by the kilo. White plastic is best, and that goes in one pile; blue in the next.<br><br>Paper, if it's white and clean--that means if we can clean it and dry it. Cardboard also.<br><br>Tin cans--anything metal. Glass, if it's a bottle. Cloth or rags of any kind--that means the occasional T-shirt, a pair of pants, a bit of sack that wrapped something up. The kids round here, half the stuff we wear is what we found, but most we pile up, weigh and sell. You should see me, dressed to kill. I wear a pair of hacked-off jeans and a too-big T-shirt that I can roll up onto my head when the sun gets bad. I don't wear shoes--one, because I don't have any, and two, because you need to feel with your feet. The Mission School had a big push on getting us boots, but most of the kids sold them on. The trash is soft, and our feet are hard as hooves.<br><br>Rubber is good. Just last week we got a freak delivery of old tyres from somewhere. Snapped up in minutes, they were, the men getting in first and driving us off. A half-good tyre can fetch half a dollar, and a dead tyre holds down the roof of your house. We get the fast food too, and that's a little business in itself. It doesn't come near me and Gardo, it goes down the far end, and about a hundred kids sort out the straws, the cups and the chicken bones. Everything turned, cleaned and bagged up--cycled down to the weighers, weighed and sold. Onto the trucks that take it back to the city, round it goes. On a good day I'll make two hundred pesos. On a bad, maybe fifty? So you live day to day and hope you don't get sick.

Scottish playwright, novelist, short-story writer, biographer, and author of juvenile fiction. Although he wrote more than forty plays and dozens of short stories, novels, and magazine articles, Barrie is best known today for a single creation: the tale of Peter Pan, which he told in various forms in stories, novels, and most notably the play Peter Pan (1904). The play has been staged throughout the Western world, particularly in Britain and America, where it has been nearly continuously performed since its first production. Part fantasy, fairy tale, adventure story, and pantomime, Peter Pan has been described as a modern myth in its archetypal treatment of childhood innocence, separation, and death, and Barrie has been compared favorably to Lewis Carroll and Hans Christian Andersen for his creation of one of the most popular children&#39;s works ever written. With the dramatization of Peter Pan in 1904, Barrie produced &#34;that terrible masterpiece&#34; as Peter Llewelyn Davies later termed it. Joining the charismatic hero in the play are Wendy, John, and Michael Darling; their parents, the loving Mrs. Darling and her befuddled and somewhat childish husband; Nana, the Newfoundland dog who acts as the family&#39;s nanny; assorted fairies, most notably Peter&#39;s devoted companion Tinker Bell; the Lost Boys; Indians and pirates; and Peter&#39;s nemesis, the villainous Captain Hook. Peter Pan enters the Darling nursery looking for his lost shadow. Wendy offers to sew his shadow back on and, in return, Pan offers to fly Wendy and her two brothers to Never Land. Once there, Wendy assumes the role of mother/wife to Peter and the Lost Boys, and the Darling children become immersed in a series of thrilling adventures. Captain Hook becomes jealous of Wendy&#39;s attentions toward Peter and kidnaps her to be his mother. Peter rescues Wendy and vanquishes Hook. The children return home to London, but Peter chooses to remain in Never Land and remain forever young.</p><p></p><h2>British Army On Campaign (2) 1854-56 : The Crimea (Men at Arms Series, 196)</h2><p>In 1854 the British Army was committed to its first major war, namely the Crimean War (1853-1856),&nbsp;against a European power since 1815. The expeditionary force, or 'Army of the East', was despatched to Turkey nominally to support the Ottoman Empire in its war with Russia; but in reality to check, in alliance with France and later Sardinia, Russian ambitions for an outlet to the Mediterranean. Despite many failures in the conduct of operations and administration, the war was won in two years and Russian designs on the Balkans and Levant were thwarted for two decades.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Michael Barthorp was educated at Wellington College and was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in 1946.

They range over paying attention to our thoughts, feelings, and actions; noticing our bodies from our hands to our feet; noticing our sensory capacities and our desires and disappointments; noticing the way we may start each day with a hope, a rush to do,' or a dread. Drawing on a multitude of contemplative and scientific thinkers, this book is full of wonderful ideas for mindfulness practices for each day of the year that lift us out of the treadmill of the automatic pilot.

Anderson s new book seeks to provide a pragmatic but principled way forward for African American religion and life.<br><br>Anderson's work is two-sided: on one hand, he seeks to deconstruct an older, monolithic idea of African American religion as the stereotypical 'black church' experience with one relationship to the larger cultural scene. If that picture was ever accurate, it was always partial, he argues. Constructively, Anderson argues that African American religion experience 'is fundamentally understood as relational, processive, open, fluid, and irreducible'. The tradition is actually an ongoing creative exchange that relates in many ways to its history, religious institutions, and faith communities. In that creative exchange, he argues, we find here and now instances or moments or events that actualize Martin Luther King's notion of the 'beloved community'. That image, and the flexibility and pragmatism it implies, best captures the legacy and future of African American religion. Anderson offers it here not just as a nostalgic image but also as an ongoing regulative ideal for African American life and religion.</p><p>Victor Anderson is Associate Professor of Christian Ethics at Vanderbilt Divinity School.

From the Peloponnesian War to the Gulf War, from Achelleus to Lawrence of Arabia gays and lesbians have played a crucial but often hidden role in military campaigns. But recent debates over the legality of gay service in the military and the "don't ask, don't tell" policy have obscured this rich aspect of military history. Richard Burg has recovered important documents and assembled an anthology on these often invisible gay and lesbian warriors.<br> Burg shows us that the Amazons of legend weren't just fictional. We learn about the richness and variety of their culture in documents from Plato, Seneca and Suetonius. From courts-martial proceedings we discover women warriors in seventeenth century England who passed as men in order to serve, and army officers whose underground culture fostered long-term romantic friendships.<br> There are also sections on the American Civil War, World War I and II, the contemporary U.S. military as well as sailors and pirates. This anthology will forever change the way we think about "gays in the military."</p></p><p><b>B. R. Burg</b> is Professor of History at Arizona State University and the author of Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition.<p>Questions about whether or not gays should serve in the military are slightly off. The reality is that they do and always have. If proof is necessary, this insightful compilation of essays on gay and lesbian warriors throughout history is a good place to start. Accomplished historian Burg (Arizona State Univ.), who has proven himself to be a master documentarian in his previous works (e.g., Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition), has gathered important materials in the Western tradition from Homer to Clinton, making for a truly fascinating reading on this controversial subject. Court-martial proceedings and transcripts from Napoleon's army and the Royal Navy, for example, are quite evocative of their age. More frightening are those relating to the prosecution of the Knights Templars. Each of the nine chapters, written by prominent academics (e.g., John Boswell, Anne Gilmour-Bryson) and by Berg himself, covers a specific historical period (e.g., American Civil War, World Wars I and II) and includes enough contextual information to make it pertinent to academics and accessible to the lay reader.

All else is mere entertainment, without ultimate meaning, as Nisrgadatta put it so poignantly.<br><br>&#x201c;But once you have realized your true nature, when individuality has been seen for the illusion it is and so has been transcended once and for all, there is only one Totality. Now where could the Totality go? It is at once everything, completely fulfilled&#x2013;it is fulfillment itself. Therefore, the question of meaning cannot apply for one, or more accurately, for That which has realized Itself. We can only talk of &#x2018;meaning&#x2019; when there is intentionality, direction, a movement from here to there, from incomplete to complete, applying to a fragment, the false image of an &#x2018;entity.&#x2019; It could not possibly apply to that which by definition is Everything, Complete and Perfect in Itself.&#x201d;<br><br>- Robert Powell</p><p>Dr. Robert Powell is widely respected throughout the world as one of the leading authors on the subject of <i>Advaita</i>, the teaching of non-duality. In this, his most recent book, <i>Discovering the Realm Beyond Appearance</i>, he continues his explorations into this realm beyond illusion.From Chapter Eight\227"Taking One\222s Stand in the Eternal" <p>As a youngster&#x2014;I must have been about thirteen&#x2014;I did have some spontaneous experiences by which there was a kind of experience of nothingness; that is, I had disappeared as the "me" which I had provisionally known, and it and everything else had merged into one field, one background, it might be said. These experiences gave me some foretaste of the state of the Ultimate or the Totality, but without as yet much understanding as to what was going on. Later, when I seriously began to face the question "Who Am I?," I obtained a somewhat deeper understanding of a more rational kind of the nature of that "me" and the source from which it had arisen. </p><p>I subsequently became increasingly clear about the incontrovertible truth of what I had read in spiritual writings as "non-duality" or advaita. First of all, I became convinced, by direct insight, into the spurious reality of what I had carried with me since my earliest conscious days, the idea of being a "me." It is really quite simple. What proof is there that the "I" exists in a separate entity? That is the key question here. Everything else depends on that affirmation. With the "I" affirmed, there is inevitably "you," "he," and "it," or the entire world of objects &#x2014; more succinctly, the world. </p><p>Now what makes us talk about "I" and think there is an independent "person" as the referent? That is where body, mind and senses some in; through their combined action we come up with the statement and conceptualization of "I am." In other words, there is sensation, then thought and finally naming. In more detail, the body is perceived through the sense organs, conceptualized and pronounced to be a "body," where the latter concept already implies boundaries and so separation. Indeed, the whole of this process may be said to be an act of thought, which we have accepted as being the final arbiter in determining our reality. The weakness in the argument is that there is no independent authority to affirm it. For who is accepting, confirming if you will, the finding that this body-mind entity, that very same empirical reality, of course! It is the only reference system at my disposal, in which everything is being measured. Therefore, one is begging the question or! making a circular argument when stating "I am." In actual fact, there is only sensation and thought, but even that cannot be confirmed independently! Any certainty one can have is only mental. And what really is "mental"? All that is, all that was and all that will ever be is of the nature of mental construct or "appearance." It is just as in looking at a hologram, one observes certain shapes and forms that we can designate as recognizable "objects," but that have no real grounding. The true Ground of our being lies beyond all that and is nameless and totally outside the world of experience. I am reminded of a remark once made by Krishna Menon when asked about the significance of reincarnation. He replied that one dies with every thought or feeling, and so one lives many lives even within a short period of time! In other words, one is only aware of being "someone," of "having a life," during an act of thinking! Otherwise, there is no change in us, no living or dying! as opposite states. From the body-mind point of view, there are discontinuities, different bodies and different lives. But from the point of view of Consciousness, beyond identification with a particular body, there is an entirely different state. There is no longer my thought and your thought, this present life and my next life or past life, but a state of timeless and spaceless Eternity. Upon my death, I am not really affected; there is no exit, nor was there ever any entry point or so-called "birth," only a particular body appears, lingers for some time and drops away. The Consciousness does not leave me, because I ever am that Consciousness. When we talk about "he lost consciousness," it is rather the other way around: "Consciousness lost him." True death is not even a theoretical possibility, because my being as Consciousness does not permit its opposite, Unconsciousness, to exist: the Self or Consciousness, by definition, is that which lies totally beyond all pai! rs of opposites. Part of our difficulty is that we are so easily led astray by the limitations of words, their everyday meanings, and our inability to transcend them. </p><p>When one truly sees and accepts this vision of our real nature completely and unreservedly, one takes one&#x2019;s stand in the Eternal. Then one can only fall silent; the whole of our ordinary so-called life experience is seen to be nothing but a series of mind-games&#x2014;a juggling with projected images, with the "juggler" himself being only a mere image among images. All our certainties are seen to be like footprints in the sky! The only reality that emerges from all this is the Consciousness or the Self, upon which all sensation and thought is projected. This is how I came to my first basic recognition of the truth of advaita.</p></p><h2>Called To Awaken the Laity</h2><p><p>In this insightful book, John Oak, who was Senior Pastor of one of the largest Presbyterian churches in the world, suggests that the Holy Spirit initiates a certain amount of unrest and turmoil within the church in order for it to function as salt and light in the world. </p><p>Putting it positively, lay people are the best and the greatest potential the church has. Negatively, lay people are a serious challenge for the church if not mobilized. The answer to which perspective will prevail lies in the hands of church leaders. Rediscovering the biblical role of the laity demands a radical remodelling of the old framework of ministry. </p><p>Reformation is not an easy process to initiate or complete. It can place a heavy burden on a church leader if the laity are not fully involved in the process. </p></p><p>Dr John Oak(1938-2010) was Senior Pastor of Sarang Community Church, in Seoul, South Korea, which he started in 1978 with a handful of people; it is now one of the largest Presbyterian Churches in the world with 80,000 members. Dr Oak held degrees from Calvin Theological Seminary, Michigan and Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia."The people of the church are not called to assist pastors in their ministry. Rather pastors are called to assist the people in their ministry. While written in the context of a mega-church, the discipleship model of leadership development is timeless, and timely, applicable to a church of a hundred or a thousand." (R. Paul Stevens, Regent College, Vancouver)<br><br>&#x2018;John Oak is one of the outstanding leaders in the church today. Sarang Community Church is huge and still growing; and it is also solidly orthodox and Reformed. I commend this book to any individual who desires to understand the biblical principles of building a church.' (Samuel Logan ~ International Director, World Reformed Fellowship)<br><br>"An outstanding manual on discipleship. God has used the principles in this book to build a church that is both balanced and healthy, not just large." (Rick Warren, Saddleback Church, California)</p><h2>Face Down Beneath The Eleanor Cross</h2><p>Amateur sleuth and Elizabethan herbalist Susanna, Lady Appleton, is forced into a race against time when she is accused of killing her husband, Robert, and must find the killer before it is too late. Reprint.</p><p>"The story is wonderfully enhanced by herbal lore (decoctions, potions an balms) and a heated forbidden romance . . . There is always someone lurking behind an arras or scuttling along a secret passage." <i>Publishers Weekly</i>Although her era's ominous intrigues are everywhere evident, Elizabeth I appears only offstage in Lady Susanna Appleton's fourth adventure (Face Down Among the Winchester Geese, 1999, etc.), which begins in 1565 as Elizabeth's favorite, Robin Dudley, fingers herbalist Susanna as the culprit who poisoned her late husband. The unlamented Robert Appleton turns out to be more mischievous than any self-respecting corpse, posthumously summoning Susanna to meet him in Winchester via coded messageits code based, in Emersons sly joke, on John Knox's misogynist Monstrous Regiment of Women. Indeed, as copies of the book keep popping up, more women, mostly Robert's former mistresses, become likely suspects in his murder. Could one of them have turned deadly, or are Robert's political connections more likely? Vulnerable as Elizabeth's heir, Lady Mary Grey has cause to hate him. Annabel MacReynolds, a spy for French regent Catherine de Medici, has tricked Robert with her body and knows the Knox code. Then Susanna's ally Sir Walter Pendennis, his loyalty already compromised by his new inamorata Eleanor Lowell, is distracted by his rivalry with lawyer Matthew Grimshaw for Susannas friendship. Usually confident and competent, Susanna is a less dynamic figure under threat of trial and murder herself; but she has mentored both her superstitious housekeeper, Jennet, and Robert's surprising sister, Catherine, well in previous adventures. Faithful friends track the past until Susanna, in a final cozy gathering, unmasks the obvious villain. Despite a mystery that eventually turns messy and some cumbersome period detail, Emerson gets a star for high drama and the graceful planting of background information. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Some archaeologists speculate that card weaving dates back to approximately 4,000 B.C. because certain patterns which lend themselves to card weaving appear often in ancient Egyptian carvings. However, this does not seem to be sufficient evidence to support knowledge of the technique. The oldest cards found in Egypt are a set of twenty-five 4-holed wooden ones believed to have come from the Coptic Period (400-600 A. D.). What is known is that card weaving has been known from Japan, China through Asia to North African and north through Europe as far as Iceland.</p><p></p><h2>Great Gardens of London</h2><p>Great Gardens of London</p><p><strong>VICTORIA SUMMERLEY�</strong>is a national newspaper journalist who specialises in writing about gardens and gardening.

Renowned internationally for serene compositions based on timeless principles of natural forms and geometry, Caruncho has recently completed two landscapes in the United States, one in the rolling farmland of New Jersey and the other in Florida. <br><br>Caruncho draws inspiration from a wide spectrum of precedents&#x2014;the garden-academies of ancient Greek philosophers as well as important historic gardens in Spain, Italy, France, and Japan; in <i>Mirrors of Paradise</i>, Caruncho discusses his design philosophy and influences in a substantial interview with the authors. <br><br>Caruncho's gardens range from small urban spaces to grand country estates, and his design trademarks include geometric grids, rolling waves of the shrub escallonia, refined and playful pavilions and gazebos, calm reflecting pools, and vistas that capitalize on the contrasts inherent in his plant palette. In their inventive and evocative fusion of the historic and contemporary, Caruncho's garden designs are masterful compositions that exemplify the formal garden for the new millennium.</p><p><b>Gordon Taylor</b> and <b>Guy Cooper</b> are the principals of Landscape Design Ltd. in London. They have designed gardens in Ireland, France, Spain, the United States, and throughout Great Britain; they have also written numerous articles and books on herbs, gardens and garden history, including <i>Paradise Transformed: The Private Garden for the Twenty-First Century</i>.Paris-based photographer Laurence Toussaint has masterfully captured the understated elegance of master designer Caruncho's Spanish gardens with images as perfectly composed as the gardens themselves. Ferns nestled along a woodland path soothe with verdant tranquility. Ochre courtyard walls explode with fiery brilliance. Birds'-eye views of expansive vistas reveal intricate designs. If Caruncho's name is relatively unknown outside his native Spain, all that is about to change with Cooper and Taylor's monograph, the first, which introduces Caruncho in an in-depth interview, and interprets his gardens, which range from imposing country estates to confined urban spaces. Caruncho's creations manifest a fascination with landscape design borne from his first love, philosophy. Influenced by the ancient Greeks, whose gardens were mystical places intended to attract the gods, Caruncho translates these grand ideals into gardens on an equally grand scale. Page by page, the viewer is drawn into Caruncho's world of serenity and harmony, grandeur and grace. And it seems as though the gods would, indeed, be pleased. <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How are children encouraged to join lifelong crusades in behalf of beauty, compassion, and responsibility? How does a page of Mozart translate into a vision of kindness and courage?Russell Sherman teaches at the New England Conservatory.</p><h2>The Great Railway Show/Off to the Races (Thomas &amp; Friends) (Pictureback(R))</h2><p>Based on the new Thomas &amp; Friends movie releasing in summer 2016, this paperback storybook features two stories plus more than 50 stickers.

Bush</h2><p><p>In this major reassessment of George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st president of the United States, his former Chief of Staff offers a long overdue appreciation of the man and his universally underrated and misunderstood presidency.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a quiet man, but I hear the quiet people others don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;&#x2014;George H. W. Bush</p><p>In this unique insider account, John H. Sununu pays tribute to his former boss&#x2014;an intelligent, thoughtful, modest leader&#x2014;and his overlooked accomplishments. Though George H. W. Bush is remembered for orchestrating one of the largest and most successful military campaigns in history&#x2014;the Gulf War&#x2014;Sununu argues that conventional wisdom misses many of Bush&#x2019;s other great achievements.</p><p>During his presidency, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed. Bush&#x2019;s calm and capable leadership during this dramatic time helped shape a world in which the United States emerged as the lone superpower. Sununu reminds us that President Bush&#x2019;s domestic achievements were equally impressive, including strengthening civil rights, enacting environmental protections, and securing passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 1990 agreement which generated budget surpluses and a decade of economic growth.</p><p>Sununu offers unparalleled insight into this statesman who has been his longtime close friend. He worked with Bush when he was vice president under Ronald Reagan, helped him through a contentious GOP primary season and election in 1988, and as his chief of staff, was an active participant and front-row observer to many of the significant events of Bush&#x2019;s presidency. Reverential yet scrupulously honest, Sununu reveals policy differences and clashes among the diverse personalities in and out of the White House, giving credit&#x2014;and candid criticism&#x2014;where it&#x2019;s due.</p><p><em>The Quiet Man</em> goes behind the scenes of this unsung but highly consequential presidency, and illuminates the man at its center as never before.</p></p><p><p>George H. W. Bush is much too modest to brag about what he accomplished as the forty-first president of the United States. As a result, the conventional wisdom about his presidency misses many of his greatest achievements. Now this unique insider account by former chief of staff John H. Sununu finally gives this indispensable president full credit for the positive impact he had on the United States and the world.</p><p>Though Bush is rightfully remembered for orchestrating one of the largest and most effective military campaigns in history&#x2014;the first Gulf War&#x2014;Sununu argues that this success overshadowed many of his other significant accomplishments. Most important, of course, was Bush's calm and capable leadership during the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Through skillful command and his own special brand of diplomatic tact, Bush helped shape a world in which the United States emerged as the lone superpower. </p><p>These foreign policy achievements alone should earn Bush 41 a place in the front ranks of U.S. presidents, but his domestic accomplishments were equally impressive. During his single term in office, Bush passed more domestic legislation than almost any other president, which included strengthening civil rights, breaking a twelve-year logjam to enact environmental protections, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, and negotiating the 1990 budget agreement that generated federal surpluses and a decade of economic growth.</p><p>The Bush presidency also had an outsize impact on the subsequent American political landscape. Bush alumni such as Dick Cheney, Robert Gates, Colin Powell, and Roger Ailes have continued to reshape global policy, diplomacy, and media, and Clarence Thomas&#x2014;the most ardent and principled originalist in American history&#x2014;still plays an influential role on the Supreme Court.</p><p>As chief of staff, Sununu was an active participant in and front-row observer to the most significant events of the Bush presidency. Respectful yet scrupulously honest, he reveals policy conflicts and clashes, as well as inside alliances among the diverse personalities in and out of the White House, giving credit&#x2014;and candid criticism&#x2014;where it's deserved.</p><p><em>The Quiet Man</em> goes behind the scenes of this unsung but highly consequential presidency, which set the stage for the twenty-first century, and illuminates the man at its center as never before.</p><p>John H. Sununu served three terms as governor of New Hampshire and was cochairman of George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, as well as his chief of staff from 1989 to 1991. Prior to becoming governor, Sununu was associate dean of the College of Engineering at Tufts University and president of the JHS Engineering Company. After leaving the White House, he was the conservative host of CNN's <em>Crossfire</em> and won a Cable Ace Award. He lives with his wife, Nancy, in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire.</p></p><h2>A Weekend with Diego Rivera</h2><p>The modern Mexican artist talks about his life and work as if entertaining the reader for the weekend</p><p>Grade 5-8-Braun assumes Rivera's voice to trace the artist's adult life and focus on his major works. Included are some pieces of technical information on mural production, bits of Mexican history (the dominant subject of his murals), and even a patronizing line or two about his wife, Frida Kahlo. The telling is rather flat, although Rivera's egocentric view of the world is made clear by such comments as, "After completing that project I became the leading painter in the land." But the juices of his personality are drained; the fire that fueled his tempestuous life is missing. A single, matter-of-fact sentence about the headline-producing "controversy" involving his Rockefeller Center mural is indicative of the author's unwillingness to deal with Rivera's strong political persona and his relationship with the Communist party. Anne Neimark's Diego Rivera (HarperCollins, 1992) has a much more comprehensive text, but inadequate illustrations. The many reproductions here are the book's strength; they are clearly printed and demonstrate the range of his murals as well as some line illustrations he did for books.

After his powerful and feared father, a capo in N.Y.C.'s Colombo crime family, took a 50-year fall, Franzese became, at age 24, a made Colombo man. Here, with the help of former Miami Herald reporter Matera, he tells of his meteoric criminal career, which ended in 1989, at age 38, in a plea bargain taken against a 177- count Florida indictment. College-educated Franzese, disliking violence (or so he says), was apparently a businessman with a genius for operating on the fringes of laws and regulations, and here he lovingly details the schemes that caused him to become, at age 32, as financially powerful as the five New York mafia families combined. Among his coups was a gas wholesale business that took advantage of a New York law designed to return more tax dollars to the state. This complex shell game--a daisy chain that ended in a ``burnout company'' in Panama--netted Franzese $5 to $8 million per week for three years (and incidentally lowered the price of gas to Gotham motorists). Between discussions of his craft, Franzese speaks of Manuel Noriega, who provided banking connections for the gas scam; of boxing promoter Don King--a ``tough negotiator''; of black advocate Al Sharpton--``a player...[who] offered to use the considerable black power forces he commands to assist me in any way''; and of the ``Jewish Scarface''--a kingpin in the new wave of Russian and Eastern European immigrant thugs taking over parts of Brooklyn. Throughout, Franzese's estimate of his own and others' characters gives a depth unusual for this type of memoir. On a sit- down with capo de tutti capi John Gotti: ```Who's John Gotti?' I remarked to an associate....`Remember, I came from the best.' It was a psychological edge I carried throughout my mob tenure. By comparing every opponent to my father, I could never be intimidated.'' Sharp and contemporary; a bullet rising.

All rights reserved.</i>Franzese grew up on Long Island as Michael Grillo, believing himself the stepson of Mafia member John "Sonny" Franzese, with six other children in the family. He worshipped "Sonny," who may have been his biological father, abandoned his plan to become a doctor and was taken into the Cosa Nostra in 1975. With the mob's blessing, he began to work on the fringes of legitimate businesses, where he was enormously successful. Among his enterprises was a partnership dealing in retail and wholesale gasoline that evaded paying taxes; from this he made millions of dollars and began to play around with the movie industry. His first marriage on the rocks, he wed a Mexican American dancer, a born-again Christian who urged him to reform, which he did by testifying against two criminals who were sent to prison. They were not Mafiosi, nor did his testimony implicate anyone in the Mafia, but both he and Matera ( Are You Lonesome Tonight? ) believe that the mob wants to kill him anyway. The so-called "Mafia Prince," according to recent newspaper accounts, has just been arrested in Los Angeles for violating federal probation and for defaulting on bank loans and defrauding the owners of various Bel-Air mansions he rented. In some respects a conventional gangster saga, and not altogether credible. Photos not seen by PW.

And, surprisingly, through a series of lies, the town itself is never totally aware of all the Hayden family problems and decisions. Bridges manages to convey the powerful emotions of David as well as all the adults involved. His subtle changes of tone and clear, distinct enunciation adds a richness and drama to Watson&#39;s characterizations. This fine work of fiction is enhanced and enriched by this narration.

During a highly publicized official visit at the Vatican, the Pope suggests an adventure so unexpected and appealing that neither man can resist. Before dawn, two of the most beloved and famous people on the planet don disguises, slip into a waiting car, and experience the countryside as regular people. Along for the ride are the Pope's overwhelmed cousin Paolo and his estranged wife Rosa, an eccentric hairdresser with a lust for life who cannot resist the call to adventure--or the fun.<br> Against a landscape of good humor, exploration and spiritual delight, not to mention the sublime rolling hills of Italy, <i>The Delight of Being Ordinary</i> showcases the charming sensibilities of Roland Merullo (whose bestselling <i>Breakfast with Buddha</i> has sold over 200,000 copies), in a novel that makes us laugh as well as think about the demands of ordinary life, spiritual life, and the identities by which we all define ourselves.</p><p>ROLAND MERULLO is the acclaimed author of fifteen previous books, including <i>Revere Beach Boulevard, Golfing with God, </i> and <i>Breakfast with Buddha</i>. Merullo's work has been translated into German, Spanish, Korean, and Croatian, and he has won numerous prizes, including the Massachusetts Book Awards in both fiction and nonfiction. He lives in Massachusetts with his wife and two children.Day One<br><br>1<br><br>My name is Paolo dePadova&#x2014;�son of an Italian mother and an American infantryman father, and thanks to a peculiar combination of loyalty and luck I served, for a time, as First Assistant to my beloved cousin His Holiness the Pope of Rome. My tenure didn&#x2019;t last long. In fact, my duties came to an end as a direct result of the story I&#x2019;m about to tell here, a story the Pope himself asked me to make public when I felt the time was right. Parts of it will be familiar from headlines in the international news, but, as you might expect, those parts were sensationalized, tarnished by rumor, stained with misinformation. The heart of it, the essence, the real, full story, remains known only to a handful of people, myself included. I share it now in a spirit of reverence and compassion, but also in service to the truth. As my cousin liked to say, &#x201c;Anche i papi sono uomini.&#x201d; Which might be translated as &#x201c;Popes are people, too.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br><br>My odd story begins, oddly enough, with a Buddhist. Or, at least, with the visit of a famous Buddhist to the most sacred halls of Roman Catholicism. It&#x2019;s common, of course, for a pope to receive visiting heads of state&#x2014;�presidents, prime ministers, first secretaries. Catholics have a great deal of clout in the world&#x2019;s voting booths, and politicians, even the least religious politicians, like to make a papal pilgrimage. They sit for a photo op with the Pontiff, pretend to exchange ideas, make promises they never intend to keep, then fly back to their luxurious lives and seats of power.<br><br>Popes, in my experience, handle these visits with an admirable patience. Disappointed again and again, they nevertheless always seem to hope that the leaders of the world will actually behave in ways that reduce the chance of war and give comfort to their poor.<br><br>In the case of the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s visit, however, the Holy Father had good reason for optimism. Here was a man whose responsibilities were similar to his own, and whose devotion to his faith and his people was beyond question. It was the second year of our joint tenure&#x2014;�the Pope&#x2019;s and mine&#x2014;�and probably the three hundredth official visit. I was used to the frenzied preparations: security precautions, press conferences, interviews. But when I went to see the Pope that morning I could sense, almost immediately, that the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s visit would not be typical.<br><br>My cousin liked to rise at four, spend three hours in prayer, and then take a light morning meal. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays when he was in Rome, �Giorgio&#x2014;�as my parents and I had always called him&#x2014;�asked that I have breakfast with him in his relatively humble accommodations: a three-�room suite at the Domus Sanctae Marthae hotel in Vatican City. Seven a.m. sharp.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t easy for me. At seven in the morning I&#x2019;m not yet at my best&#x2014;�not that my best is very good at any hour&#x2014;�but out of devotion to the famous man and in deference to his inhumanly busy schedule, I always showed up on time. In order to reach the papal chambers, even with my top-�secret Vatican credentials, I had to run a gauntlet of security officials and various secretaries. After doing so on that morning I went, at last, along a familiar, carpeted corridor and tapped on a set of wooden doors twice my height.<br><br>&#x201c;Entra, cugino!&#x201d; the Pope always yelled joyfully. Come in, cousin! That day it was no different.<br><br>The velour curtains hanging from the windows of his dining area had been pulled aside and, even at that early hour, a golden sunlight poured through the glass. The Pope was dressed casually in dark pants and a white T-�shirt, a medal of the Blessed Mother looped on a thin chain around his neck. As was his custom and preference, he was barefoot (he liked to say it linked him, however subtly, with the poor of this world). The sunlight fell on one side of his face, catching a smile so sincere and sparkling it would have caused the most devoted atheist to convert. He gave me the warmest of embraces. Another minute and we were sitting opposite each other at a small, marble-�topped table. An aide brought a typical breakfast&#x2014;�pear slices, pots of herbal tea, two pieces of Dutch chocolate the size of bottle caps. (The Pope is famous for his sweet tooth.) We prayed over the food and began to eat, but, knowing him so well, I could see a rising tide of trouble, a splash of anxiety on the skin of his face.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Your Holiness?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, stop it,&#x201d; he said in his fake-�gruff voice. &#x201c;For the one thousandth time, Paolo, please and kindly call me &#x2018;Giorgio&#x2019; or &#x2018;Pope,&#x2019; anything but &#x2018;Your Holiness.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not worthy of that title, and it&#x2019;s like a wall between me and the cousin I love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Impossible, Your Holiness,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a simple man. If I start calling you Giorgio in private, I&#x2019;ll slip someday and say it in public.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;S�, e poi?&#x201d; Yes, and then?<br><br>&#x201c;And then my enemies will attack me, and attack you for hiring me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your judgment will come into question . . . and I&#x2019;ll be out on the street.&#x201d;<br><br>It was all a joke, a comic routine. &#x201c;You keep me sane, cousin,&#x201d; the Pope liked to say. &#x201c;Joke with me. Make me laugh. Remind me that I am, in fact, a human being, not a figurehead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s bothering you, Pope,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He smirked, looked sideways, chewed meditatively on a slice of pear. &#x201c;I can no more hide my thoughts from you than I can hide my sins from God.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Rosa?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful, intelligent, stubborn, rich, impossible to live with&#x2014;�which is why I no longer live with her. In short, the same as always. Don&#x2019;t change the subject. What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And your miraculous daughter, Anna Lisa?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, also, though I haven&#x2019;t seen her in four months. She misses you. Rosa, for some reason, thinks Anna Lisa has a serious boyfriend. Now, tell me, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>More pensive chewing. A sip of tea. As was his habit&#x2014;�part of his ongoing battle with the demon of sugar&#x2014;�he broke one of the coins of dark chocolate in two and handed the larger piece to me. Another moment and out came the truth. &#x201c;I have a confession to make.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Cardinal Forgereau, your confessor. Let me finish the meal and I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that kind of confession, Paolo. You&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;m troubled. I feel . . . lately I&#x2019;ve been feeling, I don&#x2019;t know . . . soffocato. Stifled. Constrained.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Emotionally or spiritually?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Both.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Details, please.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head, frustrated. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t describe it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Should we cancel today&#x2019;s events? Say you&#x2019;re not feeling well? The Dalai Lama and his entourage are here until tomorrow, we can still&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>More headshaking. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that. I&#x2019;m anxious to see him. I feel so badly about not meeting him when he was in Rome with the Nobel laureates. That was shameful and foolish of me. I listened to bad advice&#x2014;�a terrible weakness of mine&#x2014;�and now I want to make it up to him.&#x201d; The Pope paused again, shook his head in small movements. For a moment he couldn&#x2019;t seem to make eye contact, an exceedingly rare occurrence with this man. At last he looked up. &#x201c;Could you do me a favor, cousin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anything.&#x201d;<br><br>The Pope is from Argentina&#x2014;�everyone knows that&#x2014;�and his first language is Spanish, of course. But his parents&#x2014;�like my mother&#x2014;�were Italian-�born, and so, in honor of our shared heritage and in deference to the traditions of the Church, we usually spoke Italian with each other. This had the added advantage of not arousing suspicion among my numerous enemies in the Vatican bureaucracy. With most of the Pope&#x2019;s visitors, English was the preferred tongue. I&#x2019;m fluent, thanks to my parents, but the Holy Father sometimes struggles, and he hesitated so long then, spent so much time placing another pear slice between his lips, chewing, swallowing, that I worried he couldn&#x2019;t find the words in either of those two languages and would revert to Spanish, a tongue I habitually mangle and wreck. Another pause, and then, in an embarrassed way, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been having very odd dreams, cousin. Ho avuto stranissimi sogni, cugino. I sense that God might be sending me messages, in a kind of code.&#x201d; He paused again. His embarrassment&#x2014;�so rare&#x2014;�embarrassed me. I wanted to ask about the dreams, but I held my tongue. He looked away, looked back. He said, &#x201c;Potresti creare un piano d&#x2019;azione, cugino?&#x201d; Could you put together a plan, cousin?<br><br>&#x201c;Certo, Holy Father. Of course. What kind of plan?&#x201d;<br><br>Another smirk of displeasure. More hesitation. Then: &#x201c;If I wanted to, say . . . take an unofficial vacation . . . three days, four at the most . . . could you work out the logistics?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, Your Holiness. But anyone here could do that. Your travel office. One of the administrative assistants. People say John Paul used to slip away to Cortina d&#x2019;Ampezzo to ski. It&#x2019;s not hard to arrange such a thing, even with the security&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I would want it arranged in secret . . . to disappear for a few days,&#x201d; the Pope surprised me by saying. He was still having eye-�contact issues. Unprecedented. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go anywhere in that foolish bubble of a vehicle. It&#x2019;s a cage. It separates me from my people. And I don&#x2019;t want the bodyguards or the travel office to know about this. I don&#x2019;t want anyone to know. You and I. Rosa, if she wants to come along. We could make a side trip to see Anna Lisa, go to certain other places I have in mind. Three or four days . . . You&#x2019;re staring at me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for signs of dementia, Your Holiness . . . with all due respect. Your face is probably the most famous face on earth. Certainly the most famous in Italy. And you and I are going to sneak away? And what? Ride the Autostrada, have lunch with my daughter, take a swim? This isn&#x2019;t Buenos Aires. We&#x2019;re not nine and fourteen anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s absurd,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, as usual.&#x201d;<br><br>A veil of sadness fell across his face. To cheer him, and really only to cheer him, I said (and I will forever take responsibility for this remark), &#x201c;Maybe the Dalai Lama could come along. I&#x2019;ll give some kind of knockout pill to the two security details, then spirit you both away.&#x201d;<br><br>The Pope&#x2019;s smile illuminated the room like light from a second sun. He took a sip of tea, washed it around in his mouth, swallowed, flashed the magnificent smile again, and then seemed to slip into the garment of his papal authority. I&#x2019;d seen this before, hundreds of times, a magical transformation.

Here is a spellbinding tour de force that announces a dazzlingly fresh, natural-born storyteller in our midst.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2010</strong>: <em>Bloodroot</em> is that rare sort of family saga that feels intimate instead of epic. Set in Tennessee&#x2019;s Smoky Mountains, it&#x2019;s told largely in tandem voices that keep watchful eyes on Myra Lamb. She is a child of the mountain, tied to the land in ways that mystify and enchant those around her. There&#x2019;s magic to Myra--perhaps because she has the remarkable blue eyes foretold by a nearly-forgotten family curse--but little fantasy to her life. <em>Bloodroot </em>is as much about the Lambs as it is about a place, one that becomes ever more vivid as generations form, break free, and knit back together. Its characters speak plainly but true, they are resilient and flawed and beautiful, and there's a near-instant empathy in reading their stories, which--even in their most visceral moments--are alluring and wonderful. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em> <strong><br><br></strong><strong>A Q&amp;A with Amy Greene</strong> <br> <p></p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You&#x2019;ve lived all your life in East Tennessee&#x2019;s Smoky Mountains, a part of the country you depict vividly in <em>Bloodroot</em>. How did you imbue a familiar place with such detail and even magic? What was it like to put the language you&#x2019;d heard all your life into words on the page, as dialogue?</p> <p><strong>Amy Greene</strong>: There is, I think, an intimacy with the landscape that comes with living here. Most of my childhood was spent outdoors, a part of my experience that emerges naturally in my writing. Bringing the language I&#x2019;ve heard all my life to the page also came easily. It was instinctive to appropriate the voices of my family, friends and neighbors for the characters I was exploring in <em>Bloodroot</em>. The challenge was actually in dialing back the language once I had poured it onto the page, making it accessible to people who aren&#x2019;t familiar with these expressions and colloquialisms.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Six different character--men and women, old and young--narrate <em>Bloodroot</em>. Which characters or voices came to you first? Who was the most difficult to write, and who was the easiest? Did you have any particular people in your own life in mind when you came up with these characters originally? How did you invent the totally unique Ford Hendrix?</p> <p><strong>Amy Greene</strong>: I envisioned Johnny and Laura first, not as children but as young adults. I considered writing a short story about them, but realized I wanted to know more than I could learn about their lives within a few pages. I found myself creating a past for them, going back in time before their birth to discover what had brought them to such a dark place. Their great-grandmother, Byrdie, was the easiest character to write. She hasn&#x2019;t changed much since the first draft of <em>Bloodroot</em>, probably because I&#x2019;ve been surrounded and raised by women like her, my mom and my aunts and the ladies I went to church with. I was interested in exploring, through Byrdie, the stories I&#x2019;d heard from them about life in Appalachia during the Depression. John Odom was hardest to write. It was difficult to show all his dimensions and his conflicting emotions--to portray him not just as a villain but also as a tortured soul. I struggled to make it believable that, at least in his own mind, it was possible for John to love Myra and at the same time, to hurt her. With Ford, I wanted Johnny to have the father figure he was searching for, but the first character I created to fit that role became uninspiring to me. I knew he wasn&#x2019;t working, so I scrapped what I had written and began to imagine a character I wouldn&#x2019;t grow tired of, one who would intrigue Johnny and me both enough to follow him a long way. The intriguing figure I ended up with was Ford Hendrix.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Bloodroot</em> takes place across four generations, from the Great Depression to the present-day. At times there&#x2019;s a sociological aspect to your depiction of life in Appalachia--the poverty some families struggle with for years, the development of the land. But in some ways the story you&#x2019;ve told seems out of time--we don&#x2019;t see politics or computers, for instance. Did you consciously weave social issues into the novel? How isolated is this area of the country, and how has that changed over time? To your mind, what role does history and the passage of time play in this family story?</p> <p><strong>Amy Greene</strong>: I didn&#x2019;t think about "sociology," especially not at first. I concentrated primarily on storytelling, and building the lives of the characters. For the most part, I kept the wider world out of the picture, partly to preserve the dreamlike quality I wanted to achieve with the writing, and also to portray the sense of isolation that comes with living in Appalachia. Often the passage of time and what&#x2019;s going on outside the mountains has little impact on life here. People still grow and can their own food, get their water from wells and springs, use wood and coal for heat. There&#x2019;s a feeling of separateness from the rest of the country. But as I wrote deeper into the characters, the outside world began seeping into their stories with the progression of time. In successive drafts I was able to add another layer to <em>Bloodroot</em> by expanding those moments already present in the narrative that addressed social issues, such as the poverty that persists in parts of Appalachia. Although the quality of life has improved here over the last few decades, there are still areas where lack of education, job training, and access to public services makes life difficult. I also thought about the possibility of hopelessness as a kind of legacy, generation after generation accepting destitution as their lot in life because it&#x2019;s all they&#x2019;ve ever known. But while history and the passage of time do play important roles in this story, the familial bond of the characters mattered more to me. It transcends the changing world around them--the landscape changes, their circumstances change, people move in and out of their lives. But their blood ties are permanent.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Magic and mysticism run throughout the book--there are "granny women" who are like witches; spells and potions, including a visceral scene where a young woman swallows a chicken heart to make a man fall in love with her; and a special connection with animals, called "the touch," that is passed down in the family. How did these supernatural elements make their way into a story that often feels very true-to-life? Growing up, had you heard any similar legends? Does this type of folk magic--healing or curses or anything else--still hold weight for people?</p> <p><strong>Amy Greene</strong>: I&#x2019;ve always seen Appalachia as a magical place. I grew up hearing stories of haints and fortunetellers and curses. One of my favorite scenes in <em>Bloodroot</em> to write, where Clifford blows healing wind down Byrdie&#x2019;s throat, is based on a story my dad tells of his mother taking his baby sister to a neighbor man who cured her thrush the same way. My mom had an aunt who took off her warts by rubbing a stone in a circle around each one and then throwing the stones away. This kind of folk magic still holds weight here because, for whatever reason, people see tangible results from the practice of it. The thrush clears up, the warts fall off, and so they keep believing.</p> <p>(Photo � Amy Smotherman Burgess)</p>Amy Greene was born and raised in the foothills of East Tennessee&#x2019;s Smoky Mountains, where she lives with her husband and two children.</p><h2>Nebula Awards Showcase 2018</h2><p>The latest volume of the prestigious anthology series, published annually across six decades!

A book that harkens back to those old, worn-out paperback sf-fantasy novels but manages to haul them into the future, and pummels the prose into brilliant shape with a touch of steampunk as well: <i>Arabella of Mars</i> by David D. Levine, which should also be a winner for sweetest dedication ever.&nbsp;<br><br>Charlie Jane Anders&#x2019;s novel <i>All the Birds in the Sky</i> is a powerful blend of science fiction and fantasy plus lovely writing. The cast of characters are so well delineated that the novel can also serve as a writing lesson for those of you wanting to try that same doubled genre.<br><br>The Novella winner,<i> Every Heart a Doorway</i> by Seanan McGuire, is a lyrical, shimmering, surprising novella that brings us back to our childhood reading and forward into murder, magic, mayhem and deep-soul fantasy.<br><br>The Novelette winner, &#x2018;&#x2018;The Long Fall Up&#x2019;&#x2019; by William Ledbetter, is true science fiction with an emphasis on the science. Ledbetter, a thirty-year veteran of the aerospace industry is a strong writer, and he&#x2019;s not faking the science. The politics of birth and the place of women and pregnant women in space is a story that leaves a deep impression.<br><br>Amal El-Mohtar&#x2019;s winning short story is the crown jewel in the anthology. As a folklorist manqu�, I love how she plays with elements from folk tales. Her story is &#x201c;Seasons of Glass and Iron&#x201d; (from <i>The Starlit Wood </i>anthology). It&#x2019;s a melding of several fairy tales. First, she has used the Norwegian &#x201c;The Princess on the Glass Hill&#x201d; to delineate one of the two main characters and problems. The&nbsp;second character seems to be from &#x201c;East of the Sun &amp; West of the Moon&#x201d; combined with the Romanian story &#x201c;The Sleeping Prince,&#x201d; and perhaps &#x201c;The Black Bull of Norroway,&#x201d; all difficult and intriguing tales that I know and love. But Amal re-animates and re-imagines them through a feminist telescope, bringing the far-away and once upon a time into a newer, sharper focus.<br><br>Odd winners?

She was just a teenager when a party at a Florida beachside mansion turned into a savage killing spree, and she was one of the few to survive.

She'd heard something, some sound, as she slept in the beachfront mansion, and though it was enough to wake her up, it hadn't scared her in the least. After all, the housekeeper was sleeping somewhere on the property, as were the two live-in maids, and there were at least twenty young people scattered around the house, ranging in age from sixteen to twenty-one.<br><br>David Grant, a big, burly football star, had passed out on the sofa downstairs, she knew.

But then she'd realized something was wrong, though she couldn't explain how she'd known it. She'd tried to wake Jen Petersen, but Jen had been so deeply asleep that she hadn't responded to her urgent whispers. She'd had more success with Victoria Preston, who'd just begun to rouse, when she had seen the man enter the room. He'd been all in black, wearing what looked like a black dive suit, including a tight hood that covered everything but his eyes and mouth. He hadn't seen her or Victoria but had gone straight to Jen and stared down at her for a moment. Then, before Chloe could move, he struck.<br><br>She tried not to scream and clamped a hand over Victoria's mouth. Jen's bed was close to the door, so to get away they had to make it to the bathroom connecting their room to the bedroom next door. Amazed by how quickly her mind was working in the midst of panic, she grabbed Victoria's arm and dragged her into the bathroom, slamming the door behind them.<br><br>Victoria started screaming then, and Chloe shoved her out into the hall. As Chloe started to follow, someone closed the door from the outside, leaving her no choice but to retreat to the other bedroom.<br><br>There was more than one stranger in the house, she realized.<br><br>More than one killer.<br><br>The bedroom door started to open as someone began dragging a body in.

She stared into the room from her hiding place and saw that the killer wore clear plastic freezer bags over his feet. And his dive skin, appropriate for the balmy waters of Florida and the Caribbean, was sold by the thousands in the area.<br><br>Two killers, one in this room and one next door. Or were there more? Had Victoria made it down the stairs?<br><br>She watched his feet moving stealthily across the floor and into the bathroom.<br><br>He would find her there beneath the bed.

She looked out and saw no one, so she slipped out, hoping to find someone else alive, hoping to find something with which to save herself.<br><br>Nothing. No one. She raced along the hall to the stairway. Ochre light filled the living room at the foot of the grand stairway.<br><br>Red spilled out across the marble there, too.<br><br>Red spelled a message on the wall.<br><br><em>Death to defilers!</em><br><br>There was a picture in red, as well....<br><br>A strangely shaped hand drawn in blood.<br><br>She sensed movement behind her and turned to look. Brad Angsley, Victoria's college-age cousin, was staggering out from one of the other bedrooms, holding his head. She rushed toward him.<br><br>"He's right behind us!" he cried<br><br>"Move!" she insisted, and helped him stagger down the stairs. As they reached the great entry with its double doors, she dared a quick look back.<br><br>Someone was coming after them, another man in black, with some kind of knapsack or canvas bag over his shoulder.<br><br>Which killer was he?<br><br>Were there more ahead? What would happen when she opened the door? Would another killer be waiting there?<br><br>She had no choice but to find out. She struggled briefly with the lock, then threw open the doors and raced out, with Brad clinging to her shoulder. They made it down the long gravel path to the driveway and had almost lost themselves amidst the collection of BMWs, Audis and beat-up cars that belonged to the average kids who had made their way here.<br><br>Behind them, closing in on them, she could hear pounding footsteps.<br><br>They turned together, and she could see the knife gleaming in the moonlight, the blade dripping blood.<br><br>She leaned Brad against a car and grabbed a statue of Poseidon.

He staggered back, and she let out a scream that seemed to last forever, until she realized that Brad had broken into the car, setting off its alarm.<br><br>Lights suddenly blazed, illuminating the driveway. Chloe saw Victoria stagger from the trees bordering the drive, holding tight to Jared Walker, who appeared to be unharmed, though his face was ashen.<br><br>Victoria was waving a cell phone as she yelled, "Hang on!

Sachs&#39;s translations bring distinguished new light onto Aristotle&#39;s works, which are foundational to history of science. Sachs translates Aristotle with an authenticity that was lost when Aristotle was translated into Latin and abstract Latin words came to stand for concepts Aristotle expressed with phrases in everyday Greek language. When the works began being translated into English, those abstract Latin words or their cognates were used, thus suggesting a level of jargon and abstraction, and in some cases misleading interpretation, which was not Aristotle&#39;s language or style. These important new translations open up Aristotle&#39;s original thought to readers.</p><p>Other works by the renowned classical scholar, translator, and literary critic Francis Fergusson include "The Idea of a Theater: A Study of Ten Plays," "Sallies of the Mind: Essays," "Trope and Allegory: Themes Common to Dante and Shakespeare," and "Dante's Drama of the Mind: A Modern Reading of the "Purgatorio. <br>Translator and scholar S.

Or a wild polar bear pals with a sled dog? In this young preschool book, Catherine Thimmesh makes us wonder at the truth and mystery of unlikely animal friendships. Because the stories behind these friendships are true, not contrived, captured by photographers in many countries ranging from Siberia to Japan, they not only give readers insight into animals but challenge preconceived notions about compatibility. This book also expresses tolerance of differences and makes us look at the kindness of animals&#x2014;and humans&#x2014;a little differently.<p></p></p><p><p><b>Catherine Thimmesh</b> is the award-winning author of many books for children, including <i>Girls Think of Everything </i>and<i> Team Moon</i>, winner of the Sibert Medal.

After Silence is an electrifying, unforgettable novel that unfolds with the logic of a Greek tragedy. Carroll writes with uncompromising honesty about how secrets gnaw and kill when truth is just as devastating.</p><p>Carroll joins the literary mainstream with a novel as original and provocative as the tales of magic and wonder that made him a cult phenomenon admired by writers from Pat Conroy to Stephen King.Carroll joins the mainstream with a romantic suspense novel quite unlike his usual slippery surrealism (Outside the Dog Museum, 1991; A Child Across the Sky, 1990, etc.) and delivers what is pretty much a winner. Carroll's US cult following is limited, but his work is heralded and esteemed in Europe for its avant-garde qualities (he lives in Vienna). What carries the day for him here are characters that really grip you, and straightahead storytelling that should bring him a new batch of stateside readers. His hero is Max Fischer (perhaps a play on Hollywood animator Max Fleischer), a famed L.A. cartoonist whose main character is Paper Clip, a talking paper clip that makes eccentric comments about the realistic parts of his panels. Unmarried at 37, Max falls for Lily Aaron, a widow with a bright nine-year-old son, Lincoln. Lily loves waitressing in an oddball L.A. restaurant, and her dead-on honesty attracts Max, who finally marries her. But he finds that her honesty has its hidden neurotic side, which prompts him to hire a friendly female detective to look into Lily's background. The results lead to very upsetting facts: Lily not only was never married, and has invented her dead ex-husband, but she also kidnapped Lincoln as a small baby and has raised him as her own. Why? Because an early miscarriage left her unable to bear children, although not infertile. Max flies to New Jersey and meets (he thinks) Lincoln's lost parents, but decides to go along with Lily and keep Lincoln as his stepson. Years pass and wonderful, brilliant Lincoln grows into a jackbooted psychotic who hates Max and Lily and is ready to kill.... Strong throughout, though the story's hairpinning into suspense feels forced. Still, honest Lily's best pages run deep-- and this is Carroll's most readable ever. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For 50 years <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</i> has offered its readers a wide range of the finest crime and detective stories available and stands today as one of the foremost magazines of mystery and suspense. In anticipation of <i>AHMM</i>'s golden anniversary, Ms. Landrigan invited readers to nominate their favorite stories, and this collection is packed with popular authors and well-known characters, including Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder, Bill Pronzini's Nameless Detective, and Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski.</p> <p><b>Linda Landrigan</b> is editor-in-chief of <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</i>. She lives in New York.</p></p><p>Linda Landrigan is editor-in-chief of Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Mystery Magazine, where she presides over one of the most prestigious publishing traditions in the mystery field.Adult/High School&#x2013;In the middle of the last century, Hitchcock took popular culture by storm in a variety of media, including film, television, and short stories. Not a writer in any genre, his special genius was in identifying noir&#x2013;and sometimes comic&#x2013;tales told by others. Collected here are chronologically arranged exemplars of his taste. Opening with a story by hard-boiled champion Jim Thompson that appeared in the magazine in 1957 and ranging through such luminaries as Evan Hunter (writing as himself and as Ed McBain), Bill Pronzini, Lawrence Block, Sara Paretsky, and S. J. Rozan, and ending with Rhys Bowen's New Orleans-set tale of modern voodoo, these pieces have broad appeal. Each story has a terse paragraph introduction of its theme and its author's place in the field. The settings and plots are sorted across offices, city apartments, a small-town bank, and other common places. Some tales end with a surprise twist while others develop their momentum in a dreaded atmosphere. Mystery lovers may want to read the whole collection from cover to cover, while those not yet fans of the genre will, nonetheless, find one story or another worth the quarter hour it takes to consume. A good addition for collections serving students enrolled in short-story courses as well as for casual readers.<i>&#x2013;Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The likes of W. C. Fields, Lillian Russell, and John Barrymore eventually required the services that Towns Hospital provided. He had perfected what been called the world&#39;s only known opium cure in China after having been sent there as a United States drug treatment ambassador. Upon his return, he gave his secret remedy away and had it published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. How can it be that this most persuasive and influential personality of the 1910s can be almost entirely forgotten today? The year 2015 represents the centennial of the federal law that implemented narcotic prohibition, yet this milestone has been passing almost unnoticed. However, with the magnitude of the illegal drug problem facing the United States today, the origins of federal narcotic legislation may significantly improve our focus on the mistakes of the past so that they may not be repeated. In late 1934, Bill Wilson had a white-light experience at Towns Hospital, which led to him to become a cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous and author of the book that shared that name. Wilson carefully avoided writing about controversial figures such as Towns and Frank Buchman, founder of the Oxford Group, until many years later. AA also evolved with a singleness of purpose, which remains silent to this day about drugs. Herein one can discover that without Charles Barnes Towns, the struggling fellowship of AA in the late thirties may not have been successful. A fascinating, previously untold story can now be revealed.</p><p></p><h2>Days of Hope</h2><p>The fascists are besieging Madrid, and the newly formed International Brigade is attracting the adventurous from all parts of the world. But their untrained men, ancient equipment and obsolete planes are a poor match for Franco and the Axis powers.</p><p>Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Gettysburg Campaign</h2><p>It was the bloodiest battle of the bloodiest war in American history. It was the high tide&#x201d; of the Confederacy. At Gettysburg men fought in places that speak of the firm nature of their combat: Devils Den, the Slaughter Pen, the Valley of Death. Others sound more innocuous, that Wheat Field, the Peach Orchard, Little Round Top - but these too resound with the life and death struggle of brutal war. It was at Gettysburg that three days decided a war and changed the future of a nation. <i>The Gettysburg Campaign</i> is a revised edition of one of the best histories of the events that led to, culminated in, and followed the epic battle of Gettysburg. The story begins with the grand cavalry battles and skirmishes that marked the beginning of Lee's epic invasion of the North. Historian Albert A. Nofi follows the pattern of events that led both armies to the crossroads town of Gettysburg where the terrible whirlwind of battle intensified. The awful second day of the fight is presented in grim detail with a complete accounting of savage thrust and counterthrust. The book investigates the planning that led to the panoramic charge of General Pickett's command which ended in disaster. Finally there is the grim march from the battlefield as the Confederates retreated to Virginia timidly pursued by the victorious Federals.Supplementing the telling narrative are informative and descriptive sidebars giving nuts-and-bolts information about the battle. These cover in detail such topics as strategy, tactics, logistics, and personalities giving the reader a comprehensive perception of one of the greatest events in American history. Maps cover the movements of armies to Gettysburg and the tactical ploys for each day of the battle. <i>The Gettysburg Campaign</i> has been reedited and redesigned to include more sidebars, a complete order of battle with strength data, and new pictures. It improves a book that has already been noted as a must read&#x201d; for anyone interested in the battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War.</p><p><b>Albert A.

Gladman wields an idiosyncratic skill with description and characters that has drawn praise and attention from her contemporaries. JUICE describes a world where seemingly minor obsessions and details (like the narrator&#39;s almost random preference for juice) can structure and develop an entire story, down to its tone and style. As her narrator puts it: &#34;So far it has been sex and leaves that keep me alive.&#34;</p><p>Renee Gladman lives in Boston, Massachusettes, where she publishes Leon Works, a press for experimental fiction and cross-genre writing. Her books include NEWCOMER CAN&#39;T SWIM (Kelsey Street Press, 2007), A PICTURE-FEELING (Roof Books, 2005), THE ACTIVIST (Krupskaya, 2003), JUICE (Kelsey Street Press, 2000), NOT RIGHT NOW (Second Story Books, 1998), and Arlem (Idiom Books, 1996). A novella Event Factory is forthcoming from Dorothy, a publishing project in fall 2010. She teaches at Brown University in the Program for Literary Arts."About the body I know very little, though I am steadily trying to improve myself, in the way animals improve themselves by licking," begins Gladman's agreeably personal and expansively philosophical first collection of four fictional prose poems. Like the recent debut from fellow San Franciscan Pamela Lu (Pamela: A Novel), Gladman describes the strange dilemmas of selfhood when basic assumptions about who we are and why we do what we do have collapsed under various pressures, linguistic and otherwise. The opening 12-page "Translation" adopts various sociological poses to describe a people who "migrated off the `declining' coast" intent on discovering, via archeology and some odd logistical gestures, the secrets of its occluded past. In "Proportion Surviving," the "juice" of the book's title gets a delightful metaphorical ("I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice") and recollective workout from a Proustian glass of apple juice, to stalking the bottled aisle of the grocery store, to a love "crisis" that finally gets the speaker off it, seemingly for good. In "No Through Street," the narrator's sister wins fame for painting a series of functional but nonstandard street signs, setting off a series of oblique meditations on race, intimate relationships ("if this woman is the directionalist whom everyone knows about, who is my sister?") and cultural capital. In the most fragmented but most evocative piece, "First Sleep," the search for a "Mrs. Gladman" is carried out amidst a series of "sleeps," as if identity itself can be discerned only in the synthetic, but punctuated, moments of the subconscious. Though one wishes at times for a more vividly descriptive language or more concentrated elaboration of the ideas, this is a rich and unusual collection, like an alien codex from a culture in one's own backyard. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Delivering Justice: W.W.

How does such a distancing allow us better to discover&#x2015;and describe&#x2015;people and objects? How does distancing produce an effect? What can we gain from approaching the world obliquely? In other words, how does detour grant access? Thus begins Francois Jullien's investigation into the strategy, subtlety, and production of meaning in ancient and modern Chinese aesthetic and political texts and events. Moving between the rhetorical traditions of ancient Greece and China, Jullien does not attempt a simple comparison of the two civilizations. Instead, he uses the perspective provided by each to gain access into a culture considered by many Westerners to be strange&#x2015;"It's all Chinese to me"&#x2015;and whose strangeness has been eclipsed through the assumption of its familiarity. He also uses the comparison to shed light on the role of Greek thinking in Western civilization. Jullien rereads the major texts of Chinese thought&#x2015;The Book of Songs, Confucius's Analects, and the work of Mencius and Lao-Tse. He addresses the question of oblique, indirect, and allusive meaning in order to explore how the techniques of detour provide access to subtler meanings than are attainable through direct approaches. Indirect speech, Jullien concludes, yields a complex mode of indication, open to multiple perspectives and variations, infinitely adaptable to particular situations and contexts. Concentrating on that which is not said, or which is spoken only through other means, Jullien traces the benefits and costs of this rhetorical strategy in which absolute truth is absent.</p><p>Fran�ois Jullien is Professor at the Universit� Paris VII-Denis Diderot and director at the Institut de la Pens�e Contemporaine.

Its scope spans the twilight of peace to the final days of World War II, treating the preparation for war and the actual fighting. The perspective is that of seaman to chief petty officer, and their relations with commissioned officers of all grades. How they lived, what they felt, what were their dreams and ambitions...both for the war and afterwards. How they adapted to their new world of modern weapons and the flood of reserves who so disrupted their accustomed lives and who openly sneered at revered customs and traditions. The book is meant to portray, if not explain, the world of the professional Regular Navy man as contrasted with that of the more accepted civilian world from which they had been sequestered for so long. The wartime Reserves, by the sheer weight of their numbers, were dominant throughout the war years. The book describes what essentially a clash of cultures was in a time of great psychic and physical stress, and the effect that clash had upon the conduct of the war.</p><p>Floyd Beaver left Tulsa University after one year to join Navy just before the outbreak of WWII.

Saunders, a legendary petroleum marketing tycoon. <p>His political histories are equally varied. In addition to The Secret Six, he has written a history of the French Revolution up to the death of Robespierre, and a book about James I who sowed the seeds of the English Civil War the forerunner of our own War of Independence. </p><p>His major interests, therefore, are industrial and political. As his books most of which have been published by major New York publishers indicate, he is an expert on corporate management and pre-revolutionary periods. </p><p>Now in his eighty-first year, he continues as an author, essayist, book and film reviewer, and speaker who writes a monthly cultural journal (Otto Scott's Compass) and records his views twice a month on audio tape (Points of the Compass).

Lee, and J. E. B. Stuart from the world of great affairs. And, of course, there are the six themselves, of whom Emerson's disciple Theodore Parker is best known to modern readers." <p>"The author ties all these notables together in a skillful narrative that drives home the central thesis: the derangement of John Brown in the realm of political action resulted from a prior derangementof Brown and othersin the realm of theology. The ultimate point is that the same thing is occurring now, only more so. John Brown has his counterparts in the modern-day terroristthe FALN, the PLO, the SLAwho attack the innocent in order to remedy the alleged evils of society. Like Brown, these terrorists fill the void of modern nihilism with the fearful certitudes of violence, and have their deeds explained away as understandable, if extreme, responses to a monstrous evil." -- <i>M. Stanton Evans, Dark Horse</i><br><br>"Scott's portraits of the Six are detailed and realistic; indeed, his book is full of vigorous and accurate detail, forming a panorama of politics and culture in the 1850s. It may be grimly amusing to picture the Proper Bostonians of this successful conspiracy against the laws of the United States, meeting initially at the Boston Institute for the Blind, at their genteel work of fomenting civil war. But it is not equally amusing to contemplate the similar conspiracies of intellectuals and rich and fashionable folk which in this century have reduced half the world to ruin and tyranny." -- <i>Russell Kirk, The Birmingham News</i></p></p><h2>1996</h2><p>This fictionalized memoir of the award-winning author, Gloria Naylor, tells a story of a massive covert surveillance operation perpetrated against her by an official of the U.S. government.</p><p>Gloria Naylor is the author of The Women of Brewster Place, which won the National Book Award. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.In 1996 novelist Naylor moved to secluded St. Helena Island. A minor fracas with a crotchety neighbor, whose brother worked for the National Security Agency, set into motion a series of events that made Naylor the object of close scrutiny by the government. The intensely private Naylor found herself in the company of other prominent black writers and activists targeted by the government. She was harassed until she feared for her sanity and consulted a psychiatrist. When she discovered that her tormentors were using mind-control techniques, she fought back with the only weapon she had--her writing talent. Naylor's account, with first-person recollections of her experience and third-person speculation on the motives of her tormenters, not only raises alarms about government actions but also raises many questions about this work. She includes addenda with research and litigation regarding government experiments with mind control. Whether readers think Naylor has been the victim of pernicious abuse or that she has suffered a breakdown, her incredible book will spark debate about government surveillance and the blurring of the lines between fiction and nonfiction. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In the 50 intervening years, it never dawned on Fink that the photos had never been released. &#x201c;I was high all the time back then,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And I wasn&#x2019;t a careerist. So I didn&#x2019;t think I needed to get them published. Then this year they turn up.

His blackface minstrel songs, including &#x201c;Oh! Susanna,&#x201d; &#x201c;Old Folks at Home&#x201d; (&#x201c;Way down upon the Swanee River...&#x201d;), and &#x201c;My Old Kentucky Home,&#x201d; and his parlor ballads, such as &#x201c;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Beautiful Dreamer,&#x201d; have inspired composers, songwriters, and performers from Charles Ives and George Gershwin to Ray Charles and James Taylor. Foster devoted as much care and craft to his lyrics as he did to his timeless melodies.<br><br>In this comprehensive new selection, acclaimed music historian Ken Emerson introduces and annotates the lyrics to more than thirty of Foster&#x2019;s best and best-known songs. These masterpieces by America&#x2019;s first full-time professional songwriter, forebear of Irving Berlin, Hoagy Carmichael, Carole King, and Bob Dylan, have been so deeply absorbed into our culture that they are often assumed to be folk music. Alongside are fifty other 19th-century American popular songs that influenced Foster or that he in turn influenced, from &#x201c;Home! Sweet Home!&#x201d; in the 1820s to &#x201c;Western Home&#x201d; (the original &#x201c;Home on the Range&#x201d;) in the 1870s.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Ken Emerson</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Doo-Dah!: Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Always Magic in the Air: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era.</i>Half a century ago, Rocky and Bullwinkle depended on their kids-to-codgers TV audience knowing enough nineteenth-century poems to include a poetry-reading spot. That probably wouldn&#x2019;t fly nowadays. Use, however, another species of nineteenth-century verse&#x2014;namely, the lyrics of the period&#x2019;s pop-song hits, the likes of &#x201c;Dixie,&#x201d; &#x201c;Clementine,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Yellow Rose of Texas&#x201d;&#x2014;and a similar feature might. Pop-song scholar Emerson presents 81 such songs in their earliest incarnations in this neat collection, sorting them in categories that, used in their heyday, still make sense: &#x201c;Plantation Melodies,&#x201d; &#x201c;Parlor Songs,&#x201d; &#x201c;Drinking and Temperance Songs,&#x201d; &#x201c;Songs of Protest and Poverty,&#x201d; &#x201c;War Songs,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Comic Songs.&#x201d; The volume&#x2019;s star is Stephen Foster, 32 of whose song lyrics appear; he wrote most of them, though not those of the late comic numbers included. Briefly prefacing each category, Emerson acknowledges racism and ethnic stereotyping in many songs and also points out when a piece&#x2019;s import is antislavery or in-group comedy rather than derogatory. More explanatory notes might be nice, but this is essential Americana, anyway. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Red Butterfly: How a Princess Smuggled the Secret of Silk Out of China</h2><p><b>An enchanting tale of hidden beauty and fierce courage, retold in the style of T&#x2019;ang Dynasty poetry and illustrated with charm and grace</b><br><br>A young Chinese princess is sent from her father&#x2019;s kingdom to marry the king of a far-off land.

For unknown to the rest of the team, one of the scientists, Professor Harold Goodman, makes a startling discovery: a cluster of dermal cells, still alive after 2000 years. Based on his discovery and the theories of real-life Nobel Prize winner, Francis Crick, Goodman sets about to prove that the man on the Shroud was actually a member of an alien race, four billion years advanced to life on earth. The incredible plan to prove his theory: clone Jesus! The cloning of Jesus from the cells found on the shroud sets in motion forces which trigger worldwide cataclysms, precipitating the end of life as we know it and ushering in a New Age for the planet.</p><p>It's the end of life on earth as we know it in this page-turning apocalyptic novel <i>In His Image</i>, the first installment of the Christ Clone Trilogy. Newspaper editor Decker wangles his way onto a scientific expedition that examines the Shroud of Turin, believed by many to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ. When body cells stuck to the shroud are found to be "alive," they are cloned, and the resulting baby, Christopher, changes the course of history. The book is an interesting mix of fact and fiction (when was the last time you read a novel with footnotes?). There are nice touches of humor, and a dollop of prophetic scripture. It's difficult to peg who's "good" and who's "evil," which admirably sustains the suspense. A good edit might have smoothed some of the rough spots, and the use of bold type for emphasis is distracting. However, those less interested in the nuances of fine literature than in a fast-paced thriller will find that this novel covers all the bases. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i>Science fiction has always been a vehicle for dealing with controversial material. Rarely has the science been so well researched, the story so well told, or the message so controversial as it is in The Christ Clone Trilogy. This is a landmark series and SelectiveHouse is proud to be a part of it.</p><h2>Paper Sculpture: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><p>&#34;Paper Sculpture: A Step-By-Step Guide&#34; will teach you the technical skills necessary to create visually appealing paper sculptures.

Wood pulp, vegetable or cotton fibers are beaten down, mixed with water and pressed into paper. This organic composition provides the tensile strength yet the flexibility needed for delicate manipulation. A flat piece of paper can be very deceiving. Those who recognize its versatility and limitations are gifted with a boundless palette from which to create. Paper can be curled, rolled, folded or scored without tearing. A knowledge of flexibility, weight and texture, through hands-on application, will result in your ability to create paper sculpture images. With few cuts and gentle curves, paper is transformed from a flat surface into a 3-Dimensional network of light and shadow. Crush a piece of paper in your hand and gently flatten it out. Notice how the folds and creases enhance the overall dimension of the paper.</p><h2>Spadework: A Collection of &#34;Nameless Detective&#34; Stories</h2><p>Detective stories</p><p></p><h2>The Best of Adam Sharp: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>From the bestselling author of <i>The Rosie Project</i> comes a romantic novel about true love, second chances, and decades of great music.</b></p><p>Two decades ago, Adam Sharp&#x2019;s piano playing led him into a passionate relationship with Angelina Brown, an intelligent and strong-willed actress.

The main assaults by ever-increasing formations of Luftwaffe bombers, escorted by Bf109s and Bf110s, were initially aimed at British merchant shipping convoys plying their trade of coal and other materials from the north of England to the southern ports. These attacks by the Germans often met with increasing success although RAF Spitfires and Hurricanes endeavoured to repel the Heinkels, Dorniers and Ju88s, frequently with ill-afforded loss in pilots and aircraft. Within a month the Channel was effectively closed to British shipping. Only a change in the Luftwaffe&#x2019;s tactics in mid-August, when the main attack changed to the attempted destruction of the RAF&#x2019;s southern airfields, allowed small convoys to resume sneaking through without too greater hindrance.</p><p>Brian Cull is a highly respected Grub Street author with past publications such as Hurricanes over Tobruk, Hurricanes over Malta, Spitfires over Sicily and Buffaloes over Singapore to his credit.</p><h2>What Is Mathematics Really</h2><p>What is Mathematics, Really?</p><p>In <i>What Is Mathematics, Really?</i>, author Reuben Hersh proposes a philosophy of mathematics that he calls "humanism" and uses this philosophy to analyze age-old questions of proof, certainty, and invention versus discovery.

The disturbing pucker of a scar. The magnetic pull of the lashed eye. In this book, William A. Ewing presents an archive of over 360 photographic images of the body - beautiful, bizarre, sometimes brutally revealing - reflecting many years research and selection in museums, libraries and private collections throughout North America, Europe and Japan. Photography has intensified our obsessive attraction to images of the body for at least 150 years. This book reveals a long tradition of photographing the nude, looking at the many different ways it has been depicted in the photographer&#39;s art: the full figure nude; the body in fragments; the body as an object of sexual desire and in the realm of dream, fantasy and obsession. Also included are bodies scrutinised by medical and anatomical photographers, and those celebrated by photographers of sport, dance and fashion. Most of the greatest names in photography are represented here: Nadar, Muybridge and Roger Fenton from the earliest days of the medium; later Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham and Man Ray; and from our own time John Coplans, Robert Mapplethorpe, Barbara Kruger, Pierre Radisic and many others. Today, in the age of the supermodel and the super-athlete, consciousness of both the private and the public body has never been greater. From 19th-century erotica to the sexual politics of the 1990s, this book in a special slipcased edition provides a rich archive of bodily forms, male and female, and a record of the camera&#39;s infatuation with the human figure. William A. Ewing is a renowned authority in the field of photography. His many books include &#34;The Fugitive Gesture&#34; (1987), &#34;Flora Photographica: Masterpieces of Flower Photography&#34; (1991) and &#34;Breaking Bounds: The Dance Photography of Lois Greenfield&#34; (1992) - all published by Thames and Hudson.</p><p></p><h2>Sewing Tips &amp; Trade Secrets (Threads On)</h2><p>Featuring hundreds of instantly useful sewing ideas, techniques and methods for sewers of every skill level, these arecreative answers to sewing problems b y Threads readers that ensure easier, faster and better sewing for everyone.

The Swiss-German writer Peter Bichsel is one of the best short-prose stylists of his generation and has earned a devoted following in the German-speaking world for his charming, melancholic stories-yet his work is all but unpublished in English. This portfolio announces the great writer in our own literature through a generous selection of works spanning his entire career, from his short fiction and an excerpt from his enigmatic first novel, translated by Michael Hofmann, to his incisive and often poignant newspaper columns in Lydia Davis's translation. Candid interviews and a compilation of essays offer insight into the nature of Bichsel's artistry as it has developed over nearly six decades, highlighting the themes to which he returns time and again: the peculiar history and attitudes of the Swiss, the struggle for inner freedom and the rights of minorities, and the pleasures of reading. A special tribute by Claire-Louise Bennett rounds out this comprehensive introduction to one of Europe's most outstanding contemporary storytellers. Over the past twenty years, Canadian poet Sylvia Legris has quietly built a remarkable, multilayered body of work worthy of deep exploration and appreciation. An artist of relentless evolution and experimentation, Legris's poetics compress and expand, infusing elements of dance, botany, and human machinery into new structures and imagery that is at once wildly imaginative and deeply visceral. Alongside a retrospective selection of her poetry, capped by a series of new and unpublished works, is an exclusive conversation with fellow pioneer Will Alexander that dives into the mystery of "poetic ignition." Essays and tributes by several leading young poets imagine-and reimagine-the prismatic Legris across her many forms and permutations, completing our most eclectic portfolio to date.</p><p></p><h2>Improvising Tradition: 18 Quilted Projects Using Strips, Slices, and Strata</h2><p><p>Improvisational piecing methods anchored within traditional quilting designs.</p><p><i>Improvising Tradition</i> pairs improvisationally pieced elements with more structured, and perhaps more familiar, quilt patterns to create projects that share a fresh, clean, and modern aesthetic. Author Alexandra Ledgerwood introduces readers to three basic improv piecing techniques: strip sets, piecing improvised strata, and slice and insert, then marries them with traditional quilting designs such as log cabins, coin and bar quilts, and even Hawaiian quilts.</p><p>By using improvised elements within traditional patchwork quilt designs, Alexandra merges new and old quilting styles into projects that will appeal to a wide range of quilters. Eighteen original and modern quilting projects combine the beauty and familiarity of traditional techniques with the fresh, fun spirit of improvised quilting.</p></p><p><p><b>Alexandra Ledgerwood</b> is a modern quilter and a member of the Kansas City Modern Quilt Guild. Her work has been published in <i>Stitch</i>, <i>Modern Quilting Unlimited</i>, <i>Machine Quilting Unlimited</i>, and <i>Quilting Quarterly</i>. She enjoys working with scraps, baking, and a good cup of tea. She lives in Overland Park, Kansas, with her husband and two sons.</p><p>"<i>Improvising Tradition</i>, by Alexandra Ledgerwood of Teaginny Designs, is a gentle, refined, thoughtful introduction to the delights of improvisational quilting." --A Few Scraps</p><p>"All of the projects are really pretty and enticing, the color choices are spot on (Alexandra Ledgerwood either really knows her color wheel or has exquisite taste--or both), and the quilting, in the case of many of the projects in the book, took my breath away..." --Mark Lipinksi</p><p>" ...a great resource for improv quilting. She uses small manageable cuts which make piecing easy and quilts less wonky. The patterns are perfect for a beginning quilter or a beginning improv quilter. The tone on tone solides make the improv piecing give texture without creating a distraction with every seam and new fabric." --Cut to Pieces</p><p>"New quilters will be able to dive in and get started on making beautiful modern improv quilts with ease. They will find the sewing tips in the beginning of the book very useful. Experienced traditional quilters will be able to use familiar skills to easily venture into modern improvisation." --Portland Modern Quilt Guild</p><p>"Oh yes, this whole book was inspiring. All 17 projects are inspiring, in fact. I found myself flipping through the pages because I wanted to see how they did that funky awesome herringbone thing again, or re-read the instructions on needle-turned appliqu� once more." --Schnitzel &amp; Boo</p></p><h2>Resurrection Men</h2><p>Inspector John Rebus has messed up badly this time, so badly that he is sent to a kind of reform school for damaged cops. While there among the last-chancers known as &#34;resurrection men,&#34; he joins a covert mission to gain evidence of a drug heist orchestrated by three of his classmates. But the group has been assigned an unsolved murder that may have resulted from Rebus&#39;s own mistake. Now Rebus can&#39;t determine if he&#39;s been set up for a fall or if his disgraced classmates are as ruthless as he suspects. When Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke discovers her investigation of an art dealer&#39;s murder is tied to Rebus&#39;s inquiry, the two - protege and mentor - join forces. Soon they find themselves in the midst of an even bigger scandal than they imagined - a plot with conspirators in every corner of Scotland and deadly implications about their colleagues.</p><p>Like Edinburgh inspector John Rebus, the resurrection men of the title are treading on thin ice--they've all been sent to a short course at the Scottish Police College because they've failed in some way, generally "an issue with authority." Rebus has been known to have issues of that nature before, which only boosts his credibility with the other cops in attendance, suspected by their bosses of being on the wrong side of the fence, on the take, or even guilty of murder on several previous occasions. The dour Inspector's agenda aims to bring the higher-ups proof of the so-called Wild Bunch's nefarious activities; in the process, his own conduct in the old case he and his college classmates must rework and revisit comes under scrutiny. A solid police procedural whose protagonist, the hero of 14 other titles in this internationally acclaimed series, continues to grow on readers who are just discovering him. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Ian Rankin is an Edgar Award nominee and the recipient of the Gold Dagger Award for Fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award.

(First-Start Easy Reader Series). CIP. Troll. 1987. PLB $5.41; pap. $1.50. PreSchool-Grade 1 This series claims to use a basic vocabulary which is ``repeated often to help the young reader develop word recognition and interest in read ing.'' Recognition, yes, but the ability of the series to provoke any real inter est seems questionable. Each formulaic title has a controlled vocabulary of ap proximately 35 to 40 words, culminat ing in an easily-resolved conflict. Little Danny Dinosaur is the story of a dino saur who learns the value of being small; Muffy and Fluffy explores the theme of cooperation; Rub-a-Dub Suds tells of a pig who uses too many suds when she bathes. While the idea behind each of these tales has potential, the execution of that idea is sadly lacking, for the stories prove to be both predict able and trite, and the characters are completely one-dimensional. The two- color cartoon drawings that accompany the text are average at best. With gems such as Lobel's ``Frog and Toad'' (Harper) and Minarik's ``Little Bear'' (Harper) books readily available, there's no need to bother with these.

His relentless brutality and his bloodthirsty drive to attain victory at any cost earned him only scorn from his fellow gods in the Greek pantheon, and exile from Olympus. After thousands of years living as a man and fighting in man&#39;s bloody, petty conflicts, Ares joined the ranks of Earth&#39;s mightiest heroes - the Avengers. Now Norman Osborn - the new head of the corrupted Dark Avengers and director of the paramilitary intelligence agency H.A.M.M.E.R. - wants the finest fighting force the God of War can provide. He charges Ares with hand-picking an elite squad of soldiers and beating them into the hardest, sharpest warriors ever to wield an M-60 in each hand. And that&#39;s exactly what Ares will need, when the goddess Hera provides him with a fighting chance to regain his standing in the pantheon&#39;s eyes. And Ares is taking his men with him into the battle of their lives!

Or maybe you&#x2019;ve been stuck in a job you hate for a few years, but you still dream of doing the thing you love and that you&#x2019;re actually good at. Or maybe you&#x2019;re a boomer and you&#x2019;re ready for a second career, a personal venture that will represent a total change from what you&#x2019;ve spent most of your work life doing.</p> <p>Whatever your situation, this is the book to help you get started. <em>Finding the Sweet Spot</em> explains how sustainable, responsible, and joyful natural enterprises differ from most jobs, and it provides the framework for building your own natural enterprise. You&#x2019;ll learn how to find partners who will help make your venture successful, how to do world-class market research, how to innovate, how to build resilience into your enterprise, and how to avoid the land mines that sink so many small businesses. Most importantly, you&#x2019;ll learn how to find the "sweet spot" where your gifts, your passions, and your purpose intersect.</p> <p>And make no mistake: our world needs your talent. The current economic system and the educational system that feeds into it have let us down and are destroying our planet. We need a blossoming of natural enterprises&#x2014;connected, collaborating, and supporting ventures&#x2014;to form a dynamic new natural economy.</p> <p>Is such a thing possible? Inventor, entrepreneur, and humanist Buckminster Fuller said: "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." <em>Finding the Sweet Spot</em> presents a new model. Use it to find the work you were meant to do, thereby helping to create the world we&#x2019;re meant to live&#x2014;and make a living&#x2014;in.</p></p><p><p>Dave Pollard spent twenty-seven years with Ernst &amp; Young LLP as practice leader and advisor to entrepreneurs and then as chief knowledge officer and member of the firm's Strategy and Innovation Group. In 2010, after 40 years trying to work within the industrial growth society, Dave walked away from it. During that 40 years he advised entrepreneurs about innovation, research, sustainability, coping with complexity, and the effective use of knowledge and social media. In 2003 he started a blog called How to Save the World, which documents what he's learned about how the world really works, and how we might create better ways to live and make a living, and in 2007 he authored his first book, <em>Finding the Sweet Spot: A Natural Entrepreneur's Guide to Responsible, Sustainable, Joyful Work</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;His popular environmental and business blog can be found at howtosavetheworld.ca. He lives with his family in Toronto, Canada.</p>Pollard, a longtime entrepreneurial advisor, distills his extensive experience into sound suggestions in this useful and much-needed book. According to the author, too many individuals hesitate in creating a business in line with their goals, skills and values out of fear or a lack of self-confidence or funds. Pollard argues that entrepreneurship need not imply stress or risk, and he coaches readers through the process of identifying their passion, choosing the right collaborators and discovering unmet needs in the marketplace. Helpful charts and exercises guide the reader in finding where their purpose, passions and gifts intersect; and bite-sized case studies of entrepreneur success studies abound and help illustrate his points. Along the way, Pollard warns against settling for work that is anything less than satisfying. The ideal job&#x2014;what he calls natural enterprise or the sweet spot&#x2014;is an innovative business that touches people's lives. Pollard gives an insightful overview of the entrepreneurial process, and the book itself stands testament to the success of the author's methods. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Also Delany&#x2019;s &#x201c;Racism and Science Fiction&#x201d; combines scholarly research and personal experience in the unique true story of the first major African-American author in the genre. This collection features a bibliography, an author biography, and the candid and uncompromising Outspoken Interview.</p><p><b>Samuel R. Delany</b> changed the tone, the content, and the very shape of modern science fiction with his acclaimed novels and stories that bridged the apparent gap between science and fantasy to explore gay sexuality, racial and class consciousness, and the limits of imagination and memory.

This is a strange but compelling work in which Delany foregrounds the social context of the pair&#x2019;s meeting: the Dutch Republic&#x2019;s so-called rampjaar (&#x2018;disaster year&#x2019;) of 1672, in which England and France both invaded and a mob killed and mutilated two of the country&#x2019;s most important political figures." &#x2014;Gabriel Carlyle,&nbsp;<i>Peace News</i> (UK)<br><br>"This small volume offers two delectable ruminations (plus an interview) by Delany (<i>Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders</i>) on the nature of God and the insidiousness of racism... this remarkable melange will be enlightening for readers to follow along with him." &#x2014;<i>www.publishersweekly.com/</i><br><br>"Grand Master of SF Samuel R.

Govinda&#39;s luminous and candid account is a spectacular and gloriously poetic story of exploration and discovery, and a sensitive and lucid interpretation of Tibetan traditions. Comprised of elements from several genres - spiritual journals, adventure narratives, anthropological field reports, and philosophical commentaries, The Way of the White Clouds is one of the twentieth century&#39;s classic spiritual autobiographies and an invaluable document about a place and a way of thinking that are virtually defined by their mysteries.&#34; Robert Thurman&#39;s perceptive new introduction to the volume places Govinda&#39;s writings in historical context and expands understanding of Tibet, Buddhism, and the life of a remarkable man.</p><p></p>
